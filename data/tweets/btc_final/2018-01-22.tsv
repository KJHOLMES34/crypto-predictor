bitcoin 	If GHash.io had successfully 51% attacked bitcoin, its price would NOT have dropped to zero. It would have dropped maybe 90% and the core devs would have stayed up a few nights and made an emergency switch to PoS, at which point the price would have partially recovered.

bitcoin 	And yes, in either PoW or PoS, this WILL happen.
