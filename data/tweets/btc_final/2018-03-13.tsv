bitcoin 	What questions? There isn’t a universally agreed upon definition for “blockchain.” Bitcoin’s blockchain, THE BLOCKCHAIN, uses a “hash tree” which you seemed to think was a disqualifier. It’s not. And how other people use their crypto isn’t any of our business. Banks included.	haydentiff	2	0	1520906989	973380581500293122	https://twitter.com/haydentiff/status/973380581500293122				0.14	0.0546	0.9722992	1.0

bitcoin ripple 	What on earth are you reading? Lol. Hash trees are Merkle trees, which both Bitcoin and Ripple use (and by Ripple I mean the XRPL). People can use $ XRP for whatever they want.
