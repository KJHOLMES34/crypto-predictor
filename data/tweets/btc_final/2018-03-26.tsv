bitcoin 	Bitcoin doesn't have a marketing team so won't have any impact on the one crypto I'm interested in personally. Re: the ICOs, while I'm not interested in them, I assume any that had to advertise was probably a scam anyway so good decision by TWTR.	stacyherbert	20	2	1522076975	978287858921426944	https://twitter.com/stacyherbert/status/978287858921426944				0.20	-0.0064	0.9671536	-1.0

bitcoin 	I'd go further. Many of those kids have kept track of Bitcoin since then. That kind of mindshare is worth way more than $100.

bitcoin 	Perhaps a few students got interested and started working on it, which in and of itself is cool. Bitcoin had also already been established to an extent and had a longer term market value, so it's not entirely analogous to airdrops of new coins.	starkness	15	0	1522020081	978049226117492737	https://twitter.com/starkness/status/978049226117492737				-0.05	0.4762	0.95264924	-1.0
