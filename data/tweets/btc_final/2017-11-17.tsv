bitcoin 	that is correct as well, which is why if Satoshi decided to dump his coins, he can crash the MCap of # Bitcoin by 90% cause he is holding 5%. If 90% of # Bitcoin MCap was actively traded him dumping 5% will not make that much of a problem.

bitcoin 	It's not from Tether, but you cannot compare tether MCap to Bitcoin MCap, you have to compare it Bitcoin actively traded.	ToneVays	0	0	1510888968	931361953842315265	https://twitter.com/ToneVays/status/931361953842315265				0.14	0.4497	0.9640198511166254	1.0
bitcoin 	NO, I meant it CAN have a 90% affect on price because I cannot see more than 10% of all bitcoin in the market cap actively traded. I don't think you get it.

bitcoin 	not it can move it like 90%, cause maybe 10% of that market is tradable the rest is in cold storage by people or is lost. you have to compare tether liquidity to amount of bitcoin circulating on exchanges not total MCap.
