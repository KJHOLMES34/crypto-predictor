bitcoin 	If we want to build a censorship resistant currency, then IMO we *must* have a contingency plan for such scenarios; if the contingency plan does not exist, then that's not truly censorship resistant.

bitcoin 	So you think that if an actual 51% attack happened (as in, a real attack, not miners not cooperating with bitcoin core's dev roadmap), then the community would just sit by and let the attack continue?

bitcoin 	Mark my words: I will NEVER sell my bitcoin. It’s not about getting rich, it’s about building a multi-generational legacy.
