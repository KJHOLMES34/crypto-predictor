bitcoin 	18/ I’m just an average human who found out about Bitcoin couple years earlier than most, stuck to my beliefs, and spent a lot of time observing and learning how to play the game. Even with making a ton of mistakes, I managed to outperform the market, and I’m sure you can too.	onemanatatime	140	8	1514729744	947471335126532097	https://twitter.com/onemanatatime/status/947471335126532097				0.15	-0.012	0.9059397073138106	1.0
bitcoin 	7/ Anyway, my security is horrible. I lost 95% of my coins in 2014 getting hacked coz I didn’t have 2FA on my exchange. Got scammed on bitcointalk a couple times. Got phished once or twice.
