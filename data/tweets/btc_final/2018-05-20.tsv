bitcoin 	A Bitcoin maximalist that created a shitcoin.	SatoshiLite	72	2	1526842948	998277795854733312	https://twitter.com/SatoshiLite/status/998277795854733312				0.00	0.25	0.96618116	1.0
bitcoin 	Oh yeah, and let's not forget the 250BTC bet I had with Roger against Segwit2x. I've done more for Bitcoin than most people. So quite tired of getting attacked by Bitcoin maximalists. You and others have done a lot also, but we are in the same boat.

bitcoin 	I think I've had enough of this conversation. I've put $1MM on the line of my own personal money for the sole purpose of helping Bitcoin activate SegWit. I don't need to take shit from people about it.	SatoshiLite	105	10	1526839884	998264944347889664	https://twitter.com/SatoshiLite/status/998264944347889664				-0.08	-0.0871	0.9736336	1.0
bitcoin 	If one miner/pool didn't, another would have. And there was no guarantee that Bitcoin would get SegWit. Game theory would make it such that some miner/pool would steal the $1MM if they could.

bitcoin litecoin 	Which ones? Tell me one that had a high enough marketcap with enough liquidity that could handle $1MM. Litecoin also had the closest mining ecosystem to Bitcoin.

bitcoin litecoin 	I can't say for others, but I created Litecoin not to get rich quick. I would just be as well off today had I not created Litecoin. I created more for fun and because I think Litecoin can complement Bitcoin. And also found out later that Litecoin can help Bitcoin out with SegWit.	SatoshiLite	26	5	1526837965	998256897030479872	https://twitter.com/SatoshiLite/status/998256897030479872				0.04	0.2091	0.9691516	1.0
bitcoin litecoin 	I would also argue that Litecoin and others improve the censorship-resistance of cryptocurrency in general. If there was only Bitcoin, it becomes very easy for governments to take it down. But knowing that there will be others to take over makes cryptocurrency antifragile.	SatoshiLite	91	10	1526837032	998252982352265216	https://twitter.com/SatoshiLite/status/998252982352265216				0.16	0.2069	0.9748378	-1.0
bitcoin litecoin 	I would argue that Litecoin helped Bitcoin get SegWit faster by dispelling the SegWit FUD. It has not slowed down the adoption of Bitcoin.	SatoshiLite	56	6	1526836332	998250046607912960	https://twitter.com/SatoshiLite/status/998250046607912960				0.00	-0.3204	0.97152483	1.0
bitcoin litecoin 	I've always said that Litecoin complements Bitcoin and doesn't replace it.	SatoshiLite	13	1	1526795508	998078816969940992	https://twitter.com/SatoshiLite/status/998078816969940992				-0.09	0.0	0.9711079	-1.0
bitcoin 	To take a page from Roger's book, I was a millionaire before Bitcoin. And I've held much more in BTC than LTC and have been public about that since the beginning.	SatoshiLite	98	0	1526771473	997978007875670016	https://twitter.com/SatoshiLite/status/997978007875670016				-0.06	0.0	0.9704743	-1.0
bitcoin litecoin 	Some people think Litecoin played a huge role. Some think it was a small thing that helped a bit. To say that Litecoin played no role and that testnet was enough means that you don't understand UASF and game theory. Hard to believe that for someone who wrote a book on Bitcoin.
