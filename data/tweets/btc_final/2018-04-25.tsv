bitcoin 	Being anti-establishment and hence somewhat aligned with Bitcoin is a spectrum ranging from actual anarchists (not ancaps) through to Alex Jones followers. Unfortunately, the former are not necessarily known for their early adoption of tech or web culture vs the latter.	ummjackson	3	0	1524632840	989007933915648000	https://twitter.com/ummjackson/status/989007933915648000				-0.07	-0.17	0.97707146	-1.0

bitcoin 	Saying Bitcoin can be bigger than the impact of the internet is absurd...
