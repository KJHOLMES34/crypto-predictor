bitcoin 	I did not go bearish on # bitcoin ... I am just stating a fact ... confidence and sentiment in the market has shifted and a lot of supply will hit the market on a rebound that will serve as resistance. It may take longer to hit my price target ... I believe we will hit it though.

bitcoin 	4/ From what I can tell, once Bitcoin moves off the bottom of scyther's blade, it hits the middle of the blade and consolidates goes parabolic.
