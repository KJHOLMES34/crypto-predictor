Furthermore, they have since become more energy efficient through centralization.

bitcoin 	Yes. You have to move your money into another asset class to increase purchasing power. Bitcoin supply is fixed so as long as the utility increases over the long term it rewards the Bitcoin saver increasing their purchasing power for long term savers. It’s deflationary design.
