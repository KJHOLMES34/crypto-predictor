bitcoin 	Last time I checked # bitcoin was up 600% since April. Nothing goes up in a straight line. This is what the chart could look like in 10-15 years. I know some of the sharpest knives on the block. The consensus among us is $50,000-$100,000 within 3-5 years.

bitcoin 	Nasty correction. Has happened before. Each previous correction was met with an even more impressive rally. I'm keeping my 2018 $28,000 target on # bitcoin but may push it out to 2019.
