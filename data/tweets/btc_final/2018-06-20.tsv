bitcoin 	Founded by ousting a real Bitcoiner? Supporting a change that did not eventually reach consensus doesn't mean one is trying to compromise Bitcoin's protocol. I actually don't feel like arguing anymore.	SatoshiLite	9	0	1529499297	1009419333615800320	https://twitter.com/SatoshiLite/status/1009419333615800320				0.19	0.1739	0.9590722	1.0
bitcoin 	I talk to people. People at Bitcoin conferences. Regular Bitcoin users that I meet. It's easy to be confused about this. Trust me.

bitcoin 	Not that many people really understood Bitcoin consensus. Even now, most people still think miners decide things. It's actually quite a complicated subject.
