	There's no contradiction here; *almost any* system has friendlier output if given friendlier input, so saying that a system has friendly output and saying that a system can tolerate unfriendly input are the same thing.

	"Blockchains are ""trust machines"" because they can be trusted, because you can have a model of what a blockchain will do and this model will continue being true under a very wide variety of circumstances."	VitalikButerin	21	8	2018-01-07 10:42:05	949939185070235648	https://twitter.com/VitalikButerin/status/949939185070235648			
	"Blockchains are ""trustless"" because the circumstances under which blockchains will not unexpectedly act against your interests have very weak requirements about behavior and type of agents running them (eg. PoW can resist up to 49% dishonest, and up to ~23.2% colluding rational)"	VitalikButerin	16	4	2018-01-07 10:41:01	949938918329278465	https://twitter.com/VitalikButerin/status/949938918329278465			
	In the most general sense, trusting a person or thing means that you have a reliable model of how it will act under various circumstances. There's also the usually implied connotation that it's specifically a reliable model of when *it will not act against your interests*	VitalikButerin	479	85	2018-01-07 10:38:20	949938239892107264	https://twitter.com/VitalikButerin/status/949938239892107264

	I’ve concluded that if we’re going to have a bubble in crypto, it needs to be 5-10x bigger than what it is today, in order for us to really benefit in the same way the dot com bubble helped with learning.

	But you are assuming every SPV client follows the same rule. That would be silly as it becomes easily exploited as you are showing.

	There are actually really only a few developers in the world that could be plug and play. The constraint isn't money, it's time. If we spend a bunch of time training folks, then we wouldn't be able to spend time building out the protocol.

	(5) Market cap is a bad metric though, of course, because it doesn't reliably reflect the true value of the token if there was a run on the market or large holders sold.

	(3) In terms of Lightning development, there are about 4 devs working full time on LND, 2 on c-lightning, and 2-3 on eclair. So less than 10 total on Lightning implementations.

	The first could be good, if it works out, but could also be bad, if it doesn't. It's the mix of good and bad prospects that matter, not the false dichotomy.

	I'm going to assume that some of this is true - again, not least because Trump is acting as if it is - and that some of it is just bullshit. But I'd like to see journalists run down which is which.

	Clearly? I can't say that because I haven't read the book yet. Klein's book collapsed when it had to go through scrutiny. Schweitzer's book became an article of faith in a way that was unwarranted.

	I read this whole thread and note how easy it would be not to realize it's about the President of the United States. So Wolff is shifty. Fine. It's worth running to ground.

	Smerconish's point is that it would be unfair to do this to a police officer, a teacher, etc. But: if, say, a cop were exhibiting this kind of erratic public behavior, his chief could order him into an exam and suspend him pending clearing it. /2	RadioFreeTom	249	43	2018-01-07 00:13:23	949780968386236416	https://twitter.com/RadioFreeTom/status/949780968386236416
