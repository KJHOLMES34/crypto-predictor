	ゲームソフト発売日の発表タイミングについては結構前にとあるサードさんが記者会見で言っていた面白いコメントがあって、「あそこのあれが出てくるなら○月ははずそうとか、逆にぶつけようとかあるから、どこの何がいつをどのタイミングで取りに行くとか高度な陣取りゲームみたいな側面がある」、と。	mochi_wsj	25	13	1513746421	943346980696330240	https://twitter.com/mochi_wsj/status/943346980696330240

	Frankly, I have to wonder if you're trying to claim scaling and privacy are orthogonal to distract from the fact that Zcash is an obvious technological dead end.

	Again, you're putting words in my mouth. My proposal is one example out of many; the bigger point is that scaling *inherently* improves privacy in some way.

bitcoin 	Ah, you're reading my original tweet too harshly. I'm simply saying that the Zcash protocol is obviously by itself a technological dead-end, like the Bitcoin protocol.

	As an example, my tx linearization concept means that most transaction history gets discarded entirely, prior to being made public *at all*.

	Or, in my case, to say: the people supporting this idea today - and their reasons - are making me sit down and think about it again. (Ex: I always assumed I was a tax cutting con.
