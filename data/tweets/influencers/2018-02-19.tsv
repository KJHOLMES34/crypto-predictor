	After the diamond industry, Blockchain is now being used to track Cobalt reserves in Congo. The ledger will be used to store details of every bag of the metal extracted until it gets to a smelter.

	Tezos was one of the largest ICOs in history, raising hundreds of millions of dollars yet they will be launching on a tight shoestring budget. This goes to show that you don't need to raise millions to write and release code. Old school crypto used to do this shit for free.

	I wonder if there's a JFK airport anywhere to celebrate his 8 long years as president. This is a tiresome but necessary exercise: Cults are irrational. FDR and Reagan deserved their honors, imo. JFK, well. But Obama and Trump?

	Much like the blessed FDR in the years before? Whose face is still on the dime? And St. Jack, whose murder earned him the half-dollar, instead of Ben Franklin? Popular presidents are not the same thing as cults. Cults are all-in, defend at all costs.

	Republicans talked that way about Reagan because the world of 1989 seemed impossible in 1979.
