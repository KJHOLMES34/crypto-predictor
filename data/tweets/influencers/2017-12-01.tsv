	So I guess here's where we disagree. I think it's possible to improve the tech to the point where the computational overhead from decentralization is perhaps 100-1000x.

	There are plenty of techs that don't fit well into the above rubric - for example, chairs. A chair makes the person who sits in it more comfortable, that's it.

bitcoin ethereum 	At the # ICO Financing conference, the SEC sidesteps nearly every question about regulating # tokens except one that gave many in the audience relief: https://www.forbes.com/sites/laurashin/2017/12/01/sec-gives-advice-on-icos-but-leaves-questions-unanswered/#762148ce398e … # bitcoin # ethereum	laurashin	54	34	1512144483	936627966271897600	https://twitter.com/laurashin/status/936627966271897600		# # #762148ce398e # #	
bitcoin 	Yes, agree with you about money being a social construct. I think Bitcoin’s value has to do with more people understanding the breakthrough it represents. (Or I hope it does! Let’s hope it’s not all people who heard from their neighbor it will make them rich.)	laurashin	2	0	1512141747	936616488722604032	https://twitter.com/laurashin/status/936616488722604032

	I don’t know if they want to scam people. At least they’re asking me. It’s more that I get these requests so regularly, I figured I’d just make a blanket statement and maybe that might cut down the insane number of messages I get a bit.	laurashin	3	0	1512118989	936521034739564544	https://twitter.com/laurashin/status/936521034739564544			
	OK, maybe none was a little strong, but this reminds about how I was once asked by a publication to write an article comparing innovations in paper money (like anti-counterfeiting) to crypto and I was like, no, it can't be done. I just fundamentally don't see them as similar.	laurashin	4	0	1512109485	936481172032335872	https://twitter.com/laurashin/status/936481172032335872

	2/ I would argue it’s less like a delusion than previous forms of money because this actually represents a profound technological breakthrough whereas previous forms of money had none.	laurashin	109	11	1512106075	936466872777584641	https://twitter.com/laurashin/status/936466872777584641

	8/ This would reduce your downside/drawdown risk in that position to 2% of your portfolio. Losing 20% of 10% is 2% of total portfolio. *these are arbitrary numbers chosen for illustrative purposes only*	VentureCoinist	49	7	1512087636	936389533268033537	https://twitter.com/VentureCoinist/status/936389533268033537
