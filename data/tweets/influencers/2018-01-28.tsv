	Your proposals still have fees; they're just charged in capital lockup cost instead of simple transparent direct cost.	VitalikButerin	45	12	2018-01-28 16:41:43	957639835614892033	https://twitter.com/VitalikButerin/status/957639835614892033			
	No more centralized than fixed block sizes.	VitalikButerin	162	12	2018-01-28 02:06:16	957419521794592769	https://twitter.com/VitalikButerin/status/957419521794592769			
	But with full blocks, we don't have that luxury, and we see how txfee markets actually are quite volatile. For expenses that are not in-the-moment in nature, like filling storage, there's no reason why they should cost $0.01 on Tuesday and $3 on Friday.	VitalikButerin	520	101	2018-01-28 00:56:07	957401866748551168	https://twitter.com/VitalikButerin/status/957401866748551168			
	Before, I discounted this, because what were essentially political pressures (but which I didn't recognize as such at the time) were successfully keeping fees in the $0.01-0.1 range, lobbying miners' mingasprices down every time ETH (or BTC) went up.	VitalikButerin	301	57	2018-01-28 00:54:17	957401407325462529	https://twitter.com/VitalikButerin/status/957401407325462529			
ethereum 	If ETH went up by 10x, that would make the system less affordable sure, but then *interest* in ethereum going up by 10x would make fees less affordable by a similar amount anway.	VitalikButerin	192	49	2018-01-28 00:53:01	957401088390557698	https://twitter.com/VitalikButerin/status/957401088390557698			
ethereum 	"For example, suppose that we claimed that the Ethereum state was ""the world hard drive"" with a maximum theoretical capacity of 120 terabytes (assume no sharding); you would need to lock up 0.001 ETH to fill up 1 KB of state (now ~$5 for a medium-sized contract)."	VitalikButerin	140	45	2018-01-28 00:52:31	957400963148546050	https://twitter.com/VitalikButerin/status/957400963148546050			
	Things we learned in 2017: in the full-blocks equilibrium, transaction fee prices are even more volatile than cryptocurrency prices. This suggests that for costs incurred over time rather than immediately (eg. storage space), setting a fixed fee may actually be not that bad.

	By the way, I read the FAQ’s - they basically implement a nanny policy. Peter Todd specifically argued for RBF with no change of destination address but the counter argument was that no-one should accept 0-conf (nanny) anyways so destination address changes should be allowed.

	No, but if they set that, then they need to wait 10+ minutes before their purchases will go through.

bitcoin 	indeed. @peterktodd tried out some double spending with different wallets https:// petertodd.org/2016/are-walle ts-ready-for-rbf … as you can see it's quite successful. however to my mind that was not a reason to deprecate 0-conf. it so happened that what Bitcoin protocol used was later opt-in RBF.	adam3us	1	0	2018-01-28 05:52:42	957476503184396289	https://twitter.com/adam3us/status/957476503184396289			@peterktodd
	I still have the same view: I argued then for opt-in RBF in preference full RBF, which that works fine for some retail use cases, and is their risk to manage & cost-in. in fact opt-in RBF is what was implemented. no software will be confused, old code wont see until confirmed.	adam3us	2	0	2018-01-28 05:08:47	957465452669820928	https://twitter.com/adam3us/status/957465452669820928			
bitcoin 	No he does have UX experience and much of bitcoin software is not that usable yet. Things don't get better by complaining, but by volunteering one's skills constructively. You have to think of the human element too - an improvement proposal is easier to use than a negative truism	adam3us	7	0	2018-01-28 04:46:01	957459724378701824	https://twitter.com/adam3us/status/957459724378701824			
	No, I too argued against breaking 0-conf with full RBF, even though around 10% of the network already mines it, because it's a business choice and it works fine for many low incremental cost or semi-trusted or in person use cases. What was implemented is opt-in RBF not full RBC.	adam3us	17	1	2018-01-28 04:37:17	957457526567686144	https://twitter.com/adam3us/status/957457526567686144			
bitcoin 	I think it will be better to focus on scaling Bitcoin on-chain & faster more scalable transactions with #LightningNetwork . If you want to help with UX work there are multiple lightning wallets that take contributions.	adam3us	24	6	2018-01-28 04:27:31	957455066520342528	https://twitter.com/adam3us/status/957455066520342528		#LightningNetwork	
	FAQs were written about this topic last year, and I thought that was all cleared up: it is opt-in. If you want fast confirmations either chance 0-conf, or use lightning, or instant services. Plus bear in mind for risk planning some part hashrate is mining full (no-optin) RBF	adam3us	13	2	2018-01-28 04:15:37	957452074605740032	https://twitter.com/adam3us/status/957452074605740032

	I think the central banks with the most to loose $ USD $ CNY $ GBP will not HODL but the smaller ones will HODL $ BTC and that will lead to a large redistribution of power and wealth.

	You would have to use a public blockchain to get that.

	I agree with compete but while there maybe pockets of centralization in $ BTC for years it proved its the most decentralised when nobody could change it in scaling debate as ultimately nobody has full control.
