	I don’t know what your deal is, but in case you ever plan on interacting with humans in the future: 1. When people make suggestions, they usually include a reason for making them. 2.

bitcoin 	I think the biggest difference is that XRP can guarantee settlement in 3.6 seconds. For P2P, that’s not really meaningful. Bitcoincash shows up quickly and that’s enough. For enterprises, finality is critical because the sums of money are HUGE. You don’t chance it with billions.	haydentiff	2	1	1512875738	939695072697872385	https://twitter.com/haydentiff/status/939695072697872385

bitcoin 	yes if that is visible and long confirmed on the bitcoin chain, that seems like a coinbase bug @ brian_armstrong	adam3us	3	1	1512941821	939972245568372736	https://twitter.com/adam3us/status/939972245568372736			@
bitcoin 	they could indeed. but they're already charging the users for the fees, so no financial incentive... and probably bottlenecked on users signing up and support costs. maybe a company that is sensitive to fees could do the work for them. or they could do it to help Bitcoin users.	adam3us	1	0	1512941723	939971833574518785	https://twitter.com/adam3us/status/939971833574518785			
	problem is there are businesses that dont care about $10 fees, pay that instead of 10c because they dont care. and there are other businesses which are then priced out. and wallets fee estimates are confused by the price insensitive no batching, no segwit, super high pri fee.	adam3us	0	0	1512941134	939969361510416384	https://twitter.com/adam3us/status/939969361510416384			
	but any wallet (that is not defective) can receive any valid spend script type, by definition as that is network standard. a sender technically can not even detect whether the recipient is using segwit (if it's using the P2SH wrapped format). spend script is the recipients choice	adam3us	1	0	1512940913	939968434632237056	https://twitter.com/adam3us/status/939968434632237056			
	there are two versions of segwit transactions: P2SH wrapped P2WPKH (backwards compatible base58 address format) and P2WPKH (bech32 encoding). the encoding is just a wallet standard, any wallet can send to a P2SH wrapped base58 segwit address. some wallets cant send to bech32	adam3us	1	0	1512940642	939967298374217728	https://twitter.com/adam3us/status/939967298374217728			
bitcoin 	. @ karel_3d could post the transaction ID or for privacy go on # bitcoin and DM a developer the txid and check it's confirmed. presumably this transaction shows as confirmed in explorers, wallet etc.	adam3us	1	0	1512940347	939966061998358528	https://twitter.com/adam3us/status/939966061998358528		#	@
bitcoin 	I think you're misinterpreting the complaint. it's network standard behaviour, on the sending side. in bitcoin the receiver doesnt care what the senders spend script is, just that the bitcoin network accepts it. there are many types of scripts various coins have been through.	adam3us	4	0	1512940175	939965339361624064	https://twitter.com/adam3us/status/939965339361624064			
	this is not coinbase upgrading to segwit (which would be nice also), but the claim is correct, this is coinbase selectively not seeing received coins. that means their wallet library code is defective. that kind of thing could be dangerous for them if it fails in other ways also.	adam3us	3	0	1512940045	939964795939307520	https://twitter.com/adam3us/status/939964795939307520			
bitcoin 	The Bitcoin network works by consensus logic. If what he's saying is being understood correctly he made a payment and he can't undo it. And their software is bugged. He just needs to get through their overloaded customer support.	adam3us	3	0	1512939682	939963273566339072	https://twitter.com/adam3us/status/939963273566339072			
	it's consensus standard. and the encoding is not seen at the network, that's wallet logic. the difference is P2WPKH vs P2SH-P2WPKH, but that is also consensus standard. if they're losing P2WPKH sourced payments their coin handling code is defective.	adam3us	7	1	1512939213	939961303983996928	https://twitter.com/adam3us/status/939961303983996928			
bitcoin 	eventually scaling tech will be adopted due to cost incentive, or when competitors make it a selling point. there are many bitcoin companies that so far *do not care* about fees / scale vs other biz priorities. if you care, and I'd argue you should, switch exchange, processor etc	adam3us	2	0	1512934508	939941569649565696	https://twitter.com/adam3us/status/939941569649565696			
	those are all likely the case FWIW.	adam3us	0	0	1512933824	939938702234492930	https://twitter.com/adam3us/status/939938702234492930			
bitcoin 	. @ TraceMayer was a gold expert first, and understands bitcoin as digital gold - he pre-dates @ rogerkver in Bitcoin. it's curious how various peoples economic understanding becomes unhinged as different super-cycles come into play. TPS / price correlation was a short-term fallacy.	adam3us	180	33	1512933000	939935246824374272	https://twitter.com/adam3us/status/939935246824374272			@ @

bitcoin 	you know technically BCH arose as a reaction to UASF, which itself was grass roots movement by Bitcoin users tired of a few mining pools/miners delaying segwit scale increase, that also fixes malleability and enables lightning (more scale). just to keep facts straight.	adam3us	254	36	1512873934	939687504306778112	https://twitter.com/adam3us/status/939687504306778112

	There is a disparate power relationship in the reviewing process, and signed reviews mess that up. Anonymity constrains what the reviewer can do. Deanonymizing can turn peer-review into a relationship-building exercise, which undermines it.	el33th4xor	2	0	1512919622	939879136264417280	https://twitter.com/el33th4xor/status/939879136264417280			
	I find it annoying when others on the PC do this unilaterally, as it reduces our collective anonymity set. I also think it's not kosher for reviewers to reach out to authors.	el33th4xor	2	0	1512919440	939878372213129217	https://twitter.com/el33th4xor/status/939878372213129217

bitcoin 	Bitcoin (and “convertible virtual currencies”) and gold are taxed as commodities in the US, thus making it very difficult for consumers to practically use as a medium of exchange.
