	In other words, the Presidency is bigger than, and in some ways distinct from, the person of Donald Trump.	prchovanec	40	6	1495884434	868428379099410434	https://twitter.com/prchovanec/status/868428379099410434			
	Correct. What I'm saying is ultimately there must be public, not merely personal, accountability for any diplomacy, including backchannels.	prchovanec	45	10	1495884224	868427495548301312	https://twitter.com/prchovanec/status/868427495548301312

	8. And no, Kushner didn't have authority from his father-in-law. He doesn't work for him in his private capacity, but public - i.e., for us.	prchovanec	72	19	1495883814	868425778215739392	https://twitter.com/prchovanec/status/868425778215739392

	6. The secrecy, lack of public accountability in backchannel conversations offers opportunities, but also poses risks.	prchovanec	83	20	1495881707	868416939714109441	https://twitter.com/prchovanec/status/868416939714109441			
	5. Even a proper backchannel, set up by officials with proper clearance and authority, can easily go off the rails. Witness Iran-Contra.	prchovanec	159	45	1495881580	868416408102817792	https://twitter.com/prchovanec/status/868416408102817792
