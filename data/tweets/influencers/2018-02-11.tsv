Taxes are your contribution to “community” activities voluntarily delegated to the gov (security, healthcare, education, etc). Money creation rather linked to GDP/economy.

	It's true that in stable, developed economies, government issued claims are taken by most people as representing real value (output). But that rests on certain assumptions which become clear when studying unstable economies.	prchovanec	0	0	1518317365	962518908342362114	https://twitter.com/prchovanec/status/962518908342362114			
	Secondly, we're talking about real not nominal assets. The government can create claims but not the output to meet those claims - unless the economy is stuck below full employment and the government spending helps solve that.	prchovanec	0	0	1518317276	962518537565868032	https://twitter.com/prchovanec/status/962518537565868032			
	First of all, what we're talking about is the equilibrium or natural interest rate, where S=I. A central bank can certain fix its policy rate above or below that number, though not without consequence.	prchovanec	0	0	1518317164	962518067459784704	https://twitter.com/prchovanec/status/962518067459784704

	if you think what happened in last 2 weeks was too hard on you.... stop trading now... you have this coming MANY more times in 2018...	Bamabroker	33	2	1518357534	962687391797596160	https://twitter.com/Bamabroker/status/962687391797596160			
	I think most new traders go broke in next 4 months... just chewed up and blown out over and over... until they are destroyed.. so many go into trading in 2017 thinking that was normal.. 2017 was a total joke.. a freaking monkey could have made money in 2017.

	I continue to view the march - June time frame may be risk on... and the real end of the bull markets may be 2nd half of 2018 as CBs have to get way way more aggressive... we are not there yet... this is the warm up this time...

	I would also add the days of SPX moving 6-7 every day up and grinding(2017) are also over... I expect 2-3 time more in next 6 months to see the market put everyone back to sleep.. VIX smashed down and then BAMMM.. over and over..	Bamabroker	24	1	1518357261	962686247176155136	https://twitter.com/Bamabroker/status/962686247176155136			
	I would lay out that pretty much everything I laid out in Jan is playing out.. and I do not expect what is happening now to be the END of everything move...
