	I don't think much forgone effort was spent on alts direct: 95% of them have no active development nor too developers. But some exchanges, processors and wallets sure spent a lot of time dealing with forks (often not by preference) and alts.	adam3us	9	2	1514068831	944699267620458498	https://twitter.com/adam3us/status/944699267620458498			
	And that this reduces the transaction size and fees asymptotically up to 5x smaller.https://twitter.com/lopp/status/944556754402271232 …	adam3us	140	26	1514068645	944698486964006914	https://twitter.com/adam3us/status/944698486964006914			
	And ask them if they have lightning network plans. Also download one of the lightning wallets and try it out. The problem is it is more profitable for exchanges to add users than improve their network efficiency, and some maybe side invested in alts and prefer to promote alts.	adam3us	41	2	1514067203	944692437968146433	https://twitter.com/adam3us/status/944692437968146433			
	You missed asking your exchange/processor/wallet to do some basic best practices that do not require protocol changes: segwit, batching, change consolidation, better fee estimates, user priority choice which can make 20x lower fees and up to 10x more scale. Or switch providers.	adam3us	73	13	1514066920	944691252276154368	https://twitter.com/adam3us/status/944691252276154368

	I am not in charge of anything. But it really winds up tech people to see people take no efforts at self help nor availing themselves of likely 10x scale within current protocol while demanding increased base. things can happen in parallel but people must upgrade software.	adam3us	2	0	1514053131	944633415470546944	https://twitter.com/adam3us/status/944633415470546944			
	I thought you were already using segwit so you have 2MB blocks. You'll get more from batching than a 2MB base block anyway, are you batching? And more from LN also as it's better scalability. So why not start with best practices and be LN early adopters next?	adam3us	8	0	1514052833	944632165710618625	https://twitter.com/adam3us/status/944632165710618625			
bitcoin 	so choose a better bitcoin exchange/service/wallet/processor. if no one makes the product there's nothing to use. ask not what Bitcoin can do for you, but what you can do for Bitcoin. it's FOSS you have to step up if you see something to improve. things dont improve themselves!	adam3us	9	1	1514031770	944543821307707392	https://twitter.com/adam3us/status/944543821307707392			
	integrate segwit, then you have a 2x blocksize adjustment. do batching, then you have up to asymptotic 5x more (probably less in practice but some), do change consolidation and it reduces fees. do some netting or a prepaid tab if it works for your use case (like changetip did).	adam3us	1	0	1514031645	944543297963520001	https://twitter.com/adam3us/status/944543297963520001			
	well you can stop using those companies, and divert users to efficient tech re-invested alternatives. but I agree, so who's coding?	adam3us	1	0	1514031143	944541189667278848	https://twitter.com/adam3us/status/944541189667278848			
bitcoin 	they need to use a better payment processor. one that is actively working on lightning. a prepaid bitcoin tab for a local area shops would be easy to code. a few bitcoiners would probably fund a startup to build that at these BTC prices. first do, then standardise so it's reused.	adam3us	14	1	1514031050	944540802562306049	https://twitter.com/adam3us/status/944540802562306049			
	some companies behaviour may also be explained by being side-invested in alts, other than company stock. I own BTC only. it's fair to ask for investment bias.	adam3us	0	0	1514030929	944540292140748800	https://twitter.com/adam3us/status/944540292140748800			
	. @ brucefenton if you want to help pickup the phone and call each CEO you know one by one to integrate segwit, do batching, change consolidation, better fee estimates, give users priority choice high/medium/low. we cant improve things if companies wont adopt them.	adam3us	80	16	1514030827	944539864602640384	https://twitter.com/adam3us/status/944539864602640384			@
bitcoin 	first step in any scaling solution is for companies to adopt tech. if they will commit to invest in tech adoption, the R&D tech community can provide solutions. see eg https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/7ljpf5/day_3_i_will_repost_this_guide_daily_until/ … upgrade user wallets, demand adoption, switch to companies with segwit, batching, etc.	adam3us	1	1	1514030498	944538484693401605	https://twitter.com/adam3us/status/944538484693401605			
bitcoin 	the best time to buy to HODL is generally now (in trenches over time). dip buying is useful to make a dollar on dollar profit from USD allocation assuming you are not 100% in bitcoin (but you can keep the profit in BTC and hodl).	adam3us	2	1	1514030317	944537728896643072	https://twitter.com/adam3us/status/944537728896643072			
bitcoin 	they will let individuals trade too I understand. there are also some crypto exchanges that offer derivatives. the @ ledgerx guys are more licensed, bitcoin covered options, safer custody.	adam3us	4	1	1514029051	944532416105938944	https://twitter.com/adam3us/status/944532416105938944			@
	maybe worth reaching out one by one to exchanges and payment processors, try to ask those with no segwit, no batching, high priority fee, no change consolidation, to follow your lead for the shared good of the network. the fee market is bid up by price insensitive participants.	adam3us	16	1	1514028834	944531506105634816	https://twitter.com/adam3us/status/944531506105634816			
	"yes volatility also feels more normal and less scary, and coins cheaper if you're look at $0.014 to $0.017/bit variance than $14,000 to $17,000/BTC. plus $0.10 looks less ""too high"" than $100k. onwards to $1/bit for 2019 :)"	adam3us	6	1	1514028621	944530612421103616	https://twitter.com/adam3us/status/944530612421103616			
bitcoin 	they both take coins off the market I think. dip buying makes dips short-lived and shallower.

	but a bit is 1000 units like 1,000,000 bits/BTC. and it's near universal for currency to have two digits after the point, so 123.45bits the 45 is satoshis=bitcents.	adam3us	0	0	1514028382	944529610053701632	https://twitter.com/adam3us/status/944529610053701632

	should display with commas also like 1,023,456.23 bits and 457.82 bits otherwise you end up with another problem with > 1 btc amounts too many digits to distinguish >1 vs > 10 btc etc or > 1,000 vs > 10,000 bits.	adam3us	3	1	1514028209	944528887140274177	https://twitter.com/adam3us/status/944528887140274177			
	interesting point. it's what I do with dip profits and fork profits - add to BTC hodlings. that's another driver for taking the freshly mined coin supply off the market.https://twitter.com/AnselLindner/status/944404767027195904 …	adam3us	52	7	1514026769	944522846826573824	https://twitter.com/adam3us/status/944522846826573824			
	coinbase has been holding a $1000 price above market for a couple of days now. can the arbitrageurs not keep up? unless there's some risk premium that's a huge 7% spread!	adam3us	15	1	1514026607	944522167697526789	https://twitter.com/adam3us/status/944522167697526789			
bitcoin 	my view: buy bitcoin, hodl. if there was a BTC denominated alt-coin bear fund, using eg 2 year short leap options or contracts on basket of alts and forks, then I'd buy that too. zero sum speculation != value. price manipulation != value.	adam3us	27	3	1514025922	944519293022212096	https://twitter.com/adam3us/status/944519293022212096

	so few people get this. unfortunately it means fee inelasticity maybe huge. companies really need to hurry to adopt best practices, cut 20x off fees add up to 10x scale. they will regret it if fees push higher & they dont have time to adapt and they lose customers to those ahead.	adam3us	34	4	1514025494	944517498615029760	https://twitter.com/adam3us/status/944517498615029760

ethereum 	False. There are academic studies that show that this claim is false. But if you don't believe them, just scoot over and take a look at the fees in Ethereum, carrying far more tx/s than BTC. The Core vision failed, and now they'll try to spin it as if it were a success.https://twitter.com/eric_lombrozo/status/944668006428196864 …	el33th4xor	267	60	1514061951	944670408263065600	https://twitter.com/el33th4xor/status/944670408263065600			
	"Many of us called it, just as we called the brokenness of the ""fee market"": LN is not the panacea it is presented to be. It has countless problems and will fail. This crop of devs will then trot out a new panacea, and string along their community for as long as they can."	el33th4xor	11	3	1514059954	944662034226008065	https://twitter.com/el33th4xor/status/944662034226008065			
	And we have also come up with on-chain and off-chain scaling solutions, NG and Teechan. NG actually alleviates any and all centralization pressure without changing Satoshi's trust model. LN, of course, messes it up, creates new centralized services, onramps and the like.	el33th4xor	13	1	1514059741	944661142177239040	https://twitter.com/el33th4xor/status/944661142177239040			
	My group has done careful measurements and devised metrics to evaluate that trade-off. We have shown that, in the range of block sizes people are fighting over, the centralization pressure is in the noise. The bogeyman they use to scare people isn't real at these block sizes.	el33th4xor	17	1	1514059570	944660421772042245	https://twitter.com/el33th4xor/status/944660421772042245			
	"Yes, the one dev has been talking about hastening a ""fee market"" even though we told him repeatedly that the design of that market is flawed and would lead to high, unpredictable fees and a terrible user experience.

	You're tweeting from an alternative universe. The high fees were designed in by the devs. They refused to increase the block size, and implemented Segwit instead, which the miners activated. Face it, if you think the current situation is a failure, it's because Core failed.	el33th4xor	40	1	1514048973	944615976783499264	https://twitter.com/el33th4xor/status/944615976783499264

	Let me give this to you on the back of an envelope. Global trade is, say, $50tn. That's physical goods. If BTC etc. make global trade 1% more efficient, that's worth $500bn. A year.

bitcoin 	4) Segwit adoption is still only at 10%. NYA companies don't see implementing it as a priority.

bitcoin 	High fees on # Bitcoin suck, but some things to keep in mind: 1) fees are calculated in sats, high Bitcoin price = higher fee in USD. 2) Miners have an incentive to spam mempool with low fee txs = real users pay higher fees on which they profit. 3) fee estimators in wallets suck.

	Yes, I can say that the Jerusalem decision was a good idea (but will not happen), and that a tax cut is a good idea (if you don't care about debt), and that Gorsuch was a good idea (if you agree that all judges will now be nuclear-optioned).

	Instead, to the very end, the GOP was # NeverObama, to the point of declaring that a presidential term for judicial appointments is 7 years, not 8.
