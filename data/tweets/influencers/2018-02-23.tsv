	No, one can be far more corrupt if they also control the issuance of money and the banking system. More power, more corruption.	aantonop	78	7	2018-02-23 23:22:08	967162689268011008	https://twitter.com/aantonop/status/967162689268011008

	My accountant did all the work. I paid income tax on all my income regardless of currency. Then, I also paid capital gains on every taxable event involving a cryptocurrency.

	Has nothing to do with personalities. If you followed the court filings, you see they set a threshold. They have to turn over account details on anyone who did transactions exceeding the threshold.

bitcoin 	Received notice from Coinbase today, that my account is one of the 13,000 that they will have to turn over to the IRS under the court order. Not surprised, I knew I would be in that group. In case you were wondering, I've filed & paid taxes for my bitcoin income, gains/losses.	aantonop	1542	353	2018-02-23 23:12:21	967160225378660352	https://twitter.com/aantonop/status/967160225378660352

	SPV nodes and full nodes represent completely different security models. The security model of SPV is a cumulative-proof-of-work model that delegates validation to miners. A fully validating node does not delegate validation. Also, SPV has major privacy risks.	aantonop	7	2	2018-02-23 20:37:50	967121342263734273	https://twitter.com/aantonop/status/967121342263734273

	In other words, I think China's civil society is stronger than its degree of political democracy, while I think the decline in America's civil society threatens to weaken its degree of political democracy.	prchovanec	0	0	2018-02-23 03:18:57	966859898792235008	https://twitter.com/prchovanec/status/966859898792235008			
	What I'm arguing is that the evolution of civil society in China is pulling it, at a very basic level, towards greater democracy, whereas the deterioration of a (healthier) civil society in the US threatens to undermine its democracy.	prchovanec	0	0	2018-02-23 03:17:09	966859445920612358	https://twitter.com/prchovanec/status/966859445920612358			
	First of all, I'm not comparing the US and China in absolute terms here. I think civil society in the US is healthier than in China, in many respects.	prchovanec	0	0	2018-02-23 03:15:46	966859094328983552	https://twitter.com/prchovanec/status/966859094328983552

	Obviously the two countries begin from very different starting points. I'm not saying I'm more hopeful about China than America. But I'm more hopeful about the prospects for democracy in China than most, and more concerned about the prospects for democracy in the US than many.	prchovanec	1	0	2018-02-23 03:11:02	966857903440187392	https://twitter.com/prchovanec/status/966857903440187392			
	At the same time, Americans enjoy democracy and relatively strong institutions supporting a free society.

	China is going through a period of renewed political repression right now, under Xi.
