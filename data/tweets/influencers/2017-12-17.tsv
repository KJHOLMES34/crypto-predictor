	6/ In short, don’t let someone *tell* you they’re going to be next gen # crypto. Let them *prove* it w/ action & adoption, and manage your position over time based on their thesis & claims playing out (or not).	cburniske	118	20	1513526610	942425028288831488	https://twitter.com/cburniske/status/942425028288831488		#	
bitcoin ethereum 	5/ I worry for people that are looking for the “next # Bitcoin” or “next # Ethereum,” and thus buy into rosy pictures painted by teams that will overpromise and underdeliver.	cburniske	86	24	1513526413	942424201746632704	https://twitter.com/cburniske/status/942424201746632704		# #	
	4/ I have no doubt there will be a great amount of innovation w/ new # cryptos, but am immediately skeptical when a project labels itself as “next gen.” It’s like proclaiming oneself to be a genius.

bitcoin ethereum 	3/ First thing to check for are the priors of the dev team for said “next gen” # cryptoasset.

	Speculation multiple = aggregate increase in network value / aggregate fiat inflow. My guess is it’s higher now than where I pegged it before, but maybe someone else can check my math and assumptions	cburniske	5	1	1513475244	942209581912125440	https://twitter.com/cburniske/status/942209581912125440			
	I back of the enveloped the “speculation multiple” between 2-10x a few months ago, put out a long thread on it then. The math is basically: how many new users per day X average $ buy in per user X number of days. That gives fiat inflow. Anything above is crypto2crypto driven	cburniske	21	8	1513475180	942209312801349633	https://twitter.com/cburniske/status/942209312801349633			
	I try and look at it as a whole for the crypto space, since so many of these assets can only be purchased via $ BTC or $ ETH as the pair (hence it must be crypto2crypto for many assets)	cburniske	9	5	1513475041	942208730619314176	https://twitter.com/cburniske/status/942208730619314176			
	Yes, the question for me has always been how much price appreciation is due to “new fiat” vs “crypto2crypto,” the latter of which can become a house of cards. The amplification of value due to crypto2crypto we could call a “speculation multiple?”	cburniske	43	9	1513474976	942208460007071744	https://twitter.com/cburniske/status/942208460007071744

	All corporate income taxes really do is reduce after-tax cash flow, and thus the value of claims on that cash flow.

	3. There is, imo, a high probability that the Trump Org and its minions have been naughty things with Russian money for ages. 4.

	1. There is clear evidence of contact with the Trump campaign and a hostile foreign power and its active arm in WL. 2.

	Meanwhile, we're treated to nightly freakouts about Fusion GPS, from people acting as if they've never heard of oppo.

	The role of Manafort, the possible quid pro quo in the RNC platform, the fact that Flynn is now a felon - this should have been more than enough. But no.

	"We can argue all day over whether this fits ""colluding,"" and which cut-out from which camp talked to whom.

	But I think there's enough circumstantial evidence - including the inability of people like Stone and POTUS himself to stop talking about it - that someone on the campaign helped advise someone what to do with those stolen materials. /4	RadioFreeTom	372	65	1513476249	942213797045063680	https://twitter.com/RadioFreeTom/status/942213797045063680
