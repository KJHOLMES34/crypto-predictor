bitcoin 	you really dont want to day trade bitcoin, IMO you will lose vs passively holding BTC. that's what HODL is saying basically. i talked about trades publicly and on bitcoincore slack eg #price -talk.

	yes I think there were a few that happened. technically funds stay on the channel but they are matched like $10 in on one channel $10 out on the other, just the funds on the channels must be sufficient. the software auto-routes through channels with sufficient funding, lowest fee	adam3us	1	0	1516391212	954440040003682306	https://twitter.com/adam3us/status/954440040003682306

bitcoin 	i buy dips & keep profits in BTC, with a dollar allocation. mostly I am doing cold BTC storage long term HODLing. the forks are a minor issue also as if you want to sell them to BTC you have to load cold keys in untested software. and defensively move bitcoin first for security.	adam3us	62	6	1516390827	954438424282279936	https://twitter.com/adam3us/status/954438424282279936

	Lightning is like a write-back disk cache. After the network has run for a while under real-world use it will also look less structured, like a fragmented disk as users route and create new channels to pay.

	many of them have committed publicly that they will do it. but give them some slack, onboarding 100k users/day in one company is hard work, if you were previously onboarding 1k users. there maybe an economic issue between retail uses and exchanges tho - different fee tolerance.	adam3us	3	0	1516354185	954284735131303937	https://twitter.com/adam3us/status/954284735131303937			
	it's an economic choice. I believe having talked with a few of the companies that it's partly that they are very busy scaling their databases and trading engines to the huge user influx as well as growing support staff, tickets etc. fees are not top of mind to exchanges.	adam3us	3	0	1516353655	954282511114289152	https://twitter.com/adam3us/status/954282511114289152			
	it was. segwit is that small blocksize increase. it started as a HF in aug 2015, until @LukeDashjr realised it could be done as a SF. much of that scale is not yet used, so it seems the scaling bottleneck is companies resources to upgrade software & configurations.	adam3us	2	0	1516353148	954280386405613568	https://twitter.com/adam3us/status/954280386405613568			@LukeDashjr
bitcoin 	no because we'd have 1000x capacity. but yes it's still a constraint and not-infinite because we hope & expect that billions of people will use bitcoin! but tech improves. eg see lightning factories which can reduce on chain channel fund/close by about 20x.	adam3us	3	0	1516352101	954275993333645312	https://twitter.com/adam3us/status/954275993333645312

	no setup and tear down net balances go on-chain, but the flow of transactions through the network is netted off chain. a 1000:1 ratio of recirculation is a significant win. more than is likely plausible even if one did not care much about centralising effects of gig blocks.	adam3us	3	0	1516351346	954272829431623680	https://twitter.com/adam3us/status/954272829431623680

	I think there are a few cases where user A paid user B and the payment went via the store funds (user A pays the store to send funds previously paid for a t-shirt to user B). anyway routing is automatic and lowest fee routing.	adam3us	1	1	1516350578	954269607619051520	https://twitter.com/adam3us/status/954269607619051520			
bitcoin 	you have to HODL bitcoin to keep funds on node routes. eg of the $10k approx in mainnet channels some of it is stuck to the blockstream store. we're leaving it there. we hold bitcoin anyway so it's no difference to us. someone who is US denominated and doesnt hold wont do that.	adam3us	0	1	1516350494	954269256882860032	https://twitter.com/adam3us/status/954269256882860032			
	they dont go in blocks, they are cut-through (netted) and routed off-chain. if the recirculation ratio is 1000:1 then 1000x as many +/-.	adam3us	1	0	1516350359	954268688370171904	https://twitter.com/adam3us/status/954268688370171904			
	that's incorrect: lightning is a cut-through transaction system that elides information via netting. all else being equal it needs less on chain space per transaction, and provides fast finality, lower fees, and reduces demand making on chain transactions cheaper also.	adam3us	3	0	1516350063	954267449242759173	https://twitter.com/adam3us/status/954267449242759173			
	eg IM application that sent the messages on chain. similar for meta protocols, that inherently require full-nodes. it is often not necessary to send the app data to the blockchain even functionally to time-stamp it, viz @opentimestamps design.	adam3us	8	0	1516348956	954262804063596544	https://twitter.com/adam3us/status/954262804063596544			@opentimestamps
bitcoin 	it was a recurring cause of confusion - people actually were looking for a p2p application message bus with store-and-forward functionality to send their app messages; because Bitcoin has similar functionality for transactional reasons they stuffed their app messages into it.	adam3us	7	0	1516348878	954262478711529473	https://twitter.com/adam3us/status/954262478711529473
