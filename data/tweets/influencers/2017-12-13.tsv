	I should rephrase. In the last 3 years, the crypto market cap has increased by 200x, but I definitely don't feel like crypto's *potential* has increased by 200x.

	Yes, agree. I guess I am reacting to the fact that not only is there not $0.5T of actual (monetizable) impact, but I currently don't even see *the necessary precursors* for it.

bitcoin 	That's a good point, but do people who join now buy because of the 21M limit? If so, why are they buying LTC or ETH on Coinbase?

	7/ For trading, things are a little more complicated, but the $ ETH channel still helps: -> There will always be short term plays to make if you can use $ BTC volatility to your advantage BUT its easier to 'trade with trend' or play alts when they are in uptrend	VentureCoinist	39	3	1513147828	940836300978118656	https://twitter.com/VentureCoinist/status/940836300978118656			
	6/ Two charts/scenarios illustrate how you can use this $ ETH channel for investment timing -> Better chance of outperforming $ BTC if you move into the alt when it is weak/cheap (beginning of 2017) -> Likely to underperform if moving into alt when alt expensive/strong (June2017)pic.twitter.com/vVui16ERkJ	VentureCoinist	48	6	1513147788	940836130647347200	https://twitter.com/VentureCoinist/status/940836130647347200			
bitcoin 	5/ Bitcoin still drives all my investment decisions, allocation, risk mgmt, take profit targets, and trade time horizons. BUT the $ ETH chart is also painting a channel showing how strong/weak it (or all alts) is/are relative to $ BTC...ultimately helping timingpic.twitter.com/G1VHg9opXE	VentureCoinist	177	39	1513147590	940835302570110976	https://twitter.com/VentureCoinist/status/940835302570110976			
bitcoin 	4/ In the previous timing thread I used the $ BTC channel, which price left mid November. While I still believe Bitcoin is most useful coin to use for timing/understanding the entire space...I'll be using the $ ETH channel here.
