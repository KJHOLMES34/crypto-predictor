bitcoin 	And we're intent on continuing to improve these mechanisms over time. Though keep in mind that none of this would have existed had we not had 4 years of bitcoin experience to learn from. Imagine what will exist in 2025 with 17 years of btc/eth experience as a basis.	VitalikButerin	29	12	1513580831	942652445825495040	https://twitter.com/VitalikButerin/status/942652445825495040			
ethereum 	Ethereum's *gas schedule* is definitely evolving toward more resistance over time. There are other features that have nice negative feedback effects (eg. the fact that block time targeting now includes uncles means that a DoS that doubles uncle rates would drop capacity 10-15%)	VitalikButerin	12	4	1513580749	942652102999814144	https://twitter.com/VitalikButerin/status/942652102999814144

	Yes. Though we need to separate between (i) subjective safeguards in PoS that exist to counter 51% attacks, and (ii) the 4 month revert limit	VitalikButerin	7	3	1513574739	942626895379570688	https://twitter.com/VitalikButerin/status/942626895379570688			
bitcoin 	Imagine if when Satoshi wrote the whitepaper he had five appendices on selfish mining attacks, 51% cartel attacks, attacks on the high-timestamp rejection mechanism, etc etc. Reading that you might think bitcoin is super-complex too.

bitcoin 	If miners 51% attacked to revert three weeks of history, what blockchain do you think would *really* be considered canonical bitcoin a year from then?

	A lot of the more subtle rules in Casper are in order to handle 51% attacks. PoW in practice has all of those rules too, they're just implicit and people just don't like talking about them because that unravels the pretense of being fully algorithmic and objective.

	Also, isn't PoW dependent on soft mushy social safeguards to prevent a cartel from getting 51% and selfish mining or charging monopoly rent on transaction fees?	VitalikButerin	6	2	1513573385	942621213993549824	https://twitter.com/VitalikButerin/status/942621213993549824

	I also think assume huge deficits might be premature as we’ve increased our growth estimates for 2018. Remember the rich still pay much higher taxes. Will make more and pay even higher taxes.
