	I’ve said on @KeiserReport since 2011, don’t worry about regulators in crypto space. If Wall St. wants the (crypto) biz, laws will be rewritten (ignored).

	Wall St. mantra, we are innovators and laws need to catch up to us. I.e., no laws apply to us. On display here, as SEC indicates any of Poloniex’s indiscretions will be conveniently ignored for the sake of innovation.

	AS I’VE SAID MANY TIMES: Financial regs are written by Wall St. and as long as crypto offered a lucrative new trade we could safely assume all pertinent regs would be ignored or overwritten.

litecoin 	First of all, I didn't work on this. Don't conflate Litecoin, Litecoin Foundation, and LitePay. Secondly, there's probably stuff that LitePay can't say to the public to not risk hurting their relationships with banks and Visa. They don't owe anything to you or me.

litecoin 	That is wrong in my opinion. Card is just a stepping stone. It's not paying with Litecoin. That's not my vision of mass adoption of Litecoin.	SatoshiLite	15	5	2018-02-27 22:35:35	968600525011693568	https://twitter.com/SatoshiLite/status/968600525011693568			
	From what I know LitePay was working on a Visa card but ran some problems, which is not surprising given how hostile Visa is towards crypto. I'm guessing they worked until the last minute to try to overcome this issues but weren't able to. It's unfortunate.

litecoin 	Awesome! For Litecoin adoption, merchant processing is much more important than crypto debit cards. Using LTC debit card is not really paying with Litecoin.

	8/ Typically, improvements in privacy and functionality come at the expense of efficiency, but Scriptless Scripts appear to be a rare example that benefits functionality, privacy *and* efficiency.

	7/ By moving smart contracts off-chain, Scriptless Scripts also offer an efficiency advantage by minimizing the amount of data that needs to be verified and stored on the network level = less overhead for network participants (e.g. full nodes) and lower tx fees for users.

	6/ That move from on-chain to off-chain is also what drives the privacy benefits of Scriptless Scripts: Less information is divulged to the public network (terms of contract, participants, etc)	CremeDeLaCrypto	6	0	2018-02-27 15:23:44	968491845071196160	https://twitter.com/CremeDeLaCrypto/status/968491845071196160			
bitcoin 	5/ Scriptless scripts move the specification and execution of these smart contracts from a network-wide decision — as is currently the case for smart contracts that execute within Bitcoin Script — to a decision that only involves the participants of the smart contract.

	Maybe. Liu He has long been influential in crafting reform plans. It’s just that few of those reforms ever go through, when the challenges and costs become apparent. https:// twitter.com/adam_wutong/st atus/968449325490618368 …	prchovanec	3	1	2018-02-27 12:39:46	968450582829727744	https://twitter.com/prchovanec/status/968450582829727744

	China is, quite simply, no longer a nation of peasants with no experience of the outside world, ready to simply defer to authority. It is a lot more complicated than that.	prchovanec	3	1	2018-02-27 12:25:04	968446881637519360	https://twitter.com/prchovanec/status/968446881637519360			
	That is would, over time, change how Chinese citizens saw themselves, their possibilities, their rights, their voice, and what they have a stake. And I see that as a process that is, in fact, very much ongoing.	prchovanec	4	1	2018-02-27 12:23:02	968446370515505190	https://twitter.com/prchovanec/status/968446370515505190			
	What they did believe - and I think still has great merit to it - is that a more open economy would contribute to forces that, over time, challenge and compete with a longstanding tradition of more closed and autocratic rule.	prchovanec	4	2	2018-02-27 12:18:47	968445301081235456	https://twitter.com/prchovanec/status/968445301081235456			
	I don’t think anyone, after 1989, thought that a more economically open China would see a simple and smooth transition to liberal democracy. That’s a straw man.	prchovanec	5	0	2018-02-27 12:15:03	968444360609198081	https://twitter.com/prchovanec/status/968444360609198081			
	Has China grown more repressive under Xi Jinping? No question. Vital market reforms have also been stymied. But to pretend China isn’t vastly more open than 40 years ago, in a way that poses profound challenges to autocratic rule, seems narrow-sighted to me.	prchovanec	13	5	2018-02-27 12:09:51	968443054238691328	https://twitter.com/prchovanec/status/968443054238691328			
	In 1978, nearly everyone in China belonged to a government work unit that ruled over virtually every aspect of their daily life. No one owned a business, a home, a car, or a phone of their own.	prchovanec	6	3	2018-02-27 12:05:33	968441972242485248	https://twitter.com/prchovanec/status/968441972242485248			
	But there is no question in my mind that 40 years of market reform in China has opened the door to many dynamics that compete with the idea and practice of total state control.	prchovanec	9	0	2018-02-27 12:03:33	968441466547851264	https://twitter.com/prchovanec/status/968441466547851264

	In fact, I’d argue China’s latest moves towards greater authoritarianism have coincided with the frustration and stagnation of momentum towards deeper market reform.	prchovanec	7	1	2018-02-27 11:45:16	968436868160385025	https://twitter.com/prchovanec/status/968436868160385025

	Seems to be the argument of the day. Doesn’t really clarify whether China’s latest turn toward autocracy has taken place because of, or in defiance to, free market reforms. I’d argue the latter. https:// twitter.com/foreignpolicy/ status/968433061963665411 …	prchovanec	9	1	2018-02-27 11:40:11	968435590046867456	https://twitter.com/prchovanec/status/968435590046867456			
	In strictly political terms, perhaps. Yet millions of Chinese travel, work, study abroad in ways inconceivable in 1978. Hundreds of millions own property, in ways inconceivable then.	prchovanec	1	0	2018-02-27 05:57:23	968349317470793728	https://twitter.com/prchovanec/status/968349317470793728

	Exhibit A that he’s swimming with the current, particular in Asia, could be Japan pre-WW2, which did modernize (to the extent it was able) under an increasingly repressive autocracy, which was only unseated by its defeat in war.	prchovanec	7	1	2018-02-27 05:51:44	968347897325645825	https://twitter.com/prchovanec/status/968347897325645825			
	Exhibit A that he’s swimming against the current is pre-WWI Tsarist Russia, which many at the time saw as a model of how modernization could successfully take place under autocracy - but was in fact quietly a powder keg.	prchovanec	7	2	2018-02-27 05:49:51	968347423302176769	https://twitter.com/prchovanec/status/968347423302176769

	Marxists like to talk about “contradictions”. Well, I’d argue there is a profound contradiction today between China’s socio-economic conditions and its political ones.	prchovanec	17	6	2018-02-27 05:22:32	968340550041718784	https://twitter.com/prchovanec/status/968340550041718784			
	This tension is growing and remains unresolved. Xi extending his rule indefinitely and cracking down on civil society is not - in my view - the end of the story, by any means.	prchovanec	22	6	2018-02-27 05:18:47	968339604272271360	https://twitter.com/prchovanec/status/968339604272271360			
	This is the new hot take.

	I think the genius of Reaganism - hear me out here - was that he embraced the idea that we could only pursue the Cold War if we were as virtuous at home as we claimed to be.

	1. Yes, of course. And as I tell my students, also: Jews, gays, garden variety liberals, and others. This is why I chafe at the idea that you don't think I realize this, having lived it. 2. Yes, US racists loved SA. But you cannot remove from SA policy from Cold War Africa.

	It didn't happen because he was a bigot. It was because he was a good speechwriter.

	I think that's true. The Cold War took a toll on our very souls - the thing I teach in course at our shared institution - and it calloused us to a lot of ugly shit in the name of existential security.

	Hard to believe I'm having this argument again (because I had it in the 80s) about why Cold War realism - the ugly business of keeping SA intact rather than agitating against it - was ugly. But I see it as an artifact of the Cold War; you see it as a true expression of racism.

	This constant .. CRUSH dollar red every time SPX starts to weaken to keep it up.. is just killing Europe... near lows... going to be interesting to see how SPX does in a rising dollar environment soon.. whats happening is going to end soon.. or SPX at ATH and DAX down 25%..

	I will admit.. I expected the first 200 up off the lows as called for on spx... but I expected 2750 to hold... I did not like option #2... 2800 then 2450 after.... and only put 30% odds on that as said..

	People get SO confused.. it like they don't even remember I was looking for a HUGE rally off the lows??!?!?! and we did..... So far the ONLY thing that has happened to me without question.. was nailing a 10% drop... calling for a rally to 2720-40 and now going 40 higher!?!?!?! https:// twitter.com/Bamabroker/sta tus/962688804749565953 …	Bamabroker	22	2	2018-02-27 01:09:21	968276833010704384	https://twitter.com/Bamabroker/status/968276833010704384
