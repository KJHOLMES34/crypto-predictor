	Well an equity backed token means you get a token that represents a share in the company. Other tokens are some utility nothing to do with ownership in a company. If you want less regulations then you are advocating for ICO tokens over equity as that is already fully regulated.

	Thanks for feedback. It’s useful for us to understand your thoughts. I am personally exited about Security tokens in the months ahead but it’s a fast changing environment.	SimonDixonTwitt	1	0	1517221300	957921678348169216	https://twitter.com/SimonDixonTwitt/status/957921678348169216

	Token as we used another Blockchain as we had no need to build our own. Coin is normally using their own Blockchain. We launched Token. My mistake.	SimonDixonTwitt	1	0	1517221075	957920735892209665	https://twitter.com/SimonDixonTwitt/status/957920735892209665			
	So I think the feedback is no tokens that offer discounts. In the current environment I have only seen us and Civic so far. Security tokens are much more likely not to offer discounts.

	What is the normal way. We did not launch a coin as a funding round as we do not need funding. We launched a token to incentive users to help us with better due diligence and investor relations.

	Our policy has been to get the same discounts as others in the pre-sale. Are you staying you think discounts are scams or that you want to make sure you get biggest discount?

	So your feedback is we should allow pitches where the discount is the same to our members or if they offer discount don’t consider listing it at all? I think Security tokens will be same price for all. Our token and Civic was the only one I know with no discounts for anybody.	SimonDixonTwitt	0	0	1517220331	957917616957468672	https://twitter.com/SimonDixonTwitt/status/957917616957468672

	So you prefer equity to Tokens? Our next phase is to attempt to make equity liquid like tokens. Is that what you like to see? Or something else? When ICO boomed everybody stopped selling equity, we want to change that.	SimonDixonTwitt	1	0	1517217365	957905176576364544	https://twitter.com/SimonDixonTwitt/status/957905176576364544

bitcoin 	First, I'm no enemy of Bitcoin, having devoted more of my life to it than you have Jorge.

	For example BTC lockup is only from store of value HODL investors. ETH is both this and ERC20 engineered lockup whereby ICO investors scoop ETH to pass to ICO projects who HODL them.
