	Well an equity backed token means you get a token that represents a share in the company. Other tokens are some utility nothing to do with ownership in a company. If you want less regulations then you are advocating for ICO tokens over equity as that is already fully regulated.

	Token as we used another Blockchain as we had no need to build our own. Coin is normally using their own Blockchain. We launched Token. My mistake.	SimonDixonTwitt	1	0	2018-01-29 11:17:55	957920735892209665	https://twitter.com/SimonDixonTwitt/status/957920735892209665			
	So I think the feedback is no tokens that offer discounts. In the current environment I have only seen us and Civic so far. Security tokens are much more likely not to offer discounts.	SimonDixonTwitt	1	0	2018-01-29 11:16:20	957920339715117056	https://twitter.com/SimonDixonTwitt/status/957920339715117056			
	What is the normal way. We did not launch a coin as a funding round as we do not need funding. We launched a token to incentive users to help us with better due diligence and investor relations.

	Our policy has been to get the same discounts as others in the pre-sale. Are you staying you think discounts are scams or that you want to make sure you get biggest discount? Trying to deconstruct the feedback.	SimonDixonTwitt	0	0	2018-01-29 11:08:41	957918412801527808	https://twitter.com/SimonDixonTwitt/status/957918412801527808			
	So your feedback is we should allow pitches where the discount is the same to our members or if they offer discount don’t consider listing it at all? I think Security tokens will be same price for all. Our token and Civic was the only one I know with no discounts for anybody.

	So you prefer equity to Tokens? Our next phase is to attempt to make equity liquid like tokens. Is that what you like to see? Or something else? When ICO boomed everybody stopped selling equity, we want to change that.	SimonDixonTwitt	1	0	2018-01-29 10:16:05	957905176576364544	https://twitter.com/SimonDixonTwitt/status/957905176576364544

	For example BTC lockup is only from store of value HODL investors. ETH is both this and ERC20 engineered lockup whereby ICO investors scoop ETH to pass to ICO projects who HODL them.
