bitcoin 	John @ BitcoinErrorLog is right in saying that Bitcoin is not peer to peer. The original Bitcoin was! It had the ability to send BTC to a specific IP address.

	Can you imagine what the Linux ecosystem would look like if its maintainers labeled every distro a “shitstro” and an attack on the community?

bitcoin 	I don’t buy the whole “it’s digital gold” argument. If the government wants to take your gold they have to come to your home and use force.
