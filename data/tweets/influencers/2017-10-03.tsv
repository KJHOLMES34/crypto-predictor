bitcoin 	See the case study at link for real engineering reasons why BBSZ is more compatible with wallets, plus less risk:https://medium.com/@jgarzik/why-segwit2x-is-the-best-path-for-bitcoin-d9a4103f2fda …	jgarzik	2	1	1506983880	914982829444009990	https://twitter.com/jgarzik/status/914982829444009990			@jgarzik
	To be engineeringly precise: Base block size changes container, _not_ message. SegWit changes the message, thus integrity & authenticity.	jgarzik	1	1	1506983789	914982447774928896	https://twitter.com/jgarzik/status/914982447774928896			
	SegWit was only 1/2 of the HK consensus. Where is the other 1/2? SegWit2x is finally delivering after years of delay.	jgarzik	3	2	1506983673	914981958098341888	https://twitter.com/jgarzik/status/914981958098341888			
	It's not for the heck of it. Base block size is more compatible w/ today's wallets than SegWit & safer upgrade (BBSZ doesn't touch privkeys)	jgarzik	1	1	1506983498	914981226183905281	https://twitter.com/jgarzik/status/914981226183905281
