	Let's take Twitter as an example. They have never charged for an account and most would say it would be suicide if they did. And if an ISP tried to throttle it, I would switch to another.

	You shouldn't rely on opinions of others or authority or credentials in this space. The code is open, deterministic and understandable with some study.

	Even non lawyers can read the Constitution and can understand most of the meaning without the help of a lawyer. Read code, get the gist and ask the expert about stuff you don't understand.

ethereum 	Ethereum has a ton of the pieces of that puzzle: smart contracts give us the reach to really interact with the real world.

bitcoin 	What legitimizes our claim that society needs us, and that The Present Police should leave us alone to build the future is the power and validity of our future vision.

	It's going to need *massive* investments in public facing apps that solve real problems - things that really show people they are living in a better future - to justify these valuations.

	Because if a year from now we're going to see the crypto space at $1tn of assets, it's going to have to be like Apple: used by a billion people every day, and loved by most of them. Otherwise, it really will have been a bubble, and the wealth will drain away.

	But what I'm really saying here is this: at $500bn of assets, the crypto community is a real new global force, with phenomenal technical skills. To secure our place at the table, and our ability to negotiate with the SEC etc. we better be solving some real global problems.	leashless	179	43	1513310606	941519038504755200	https://twitter.com/leashless/status/941519038504755200

	A very low waste society is a fascinating place: everything has a price and an owner. In that sense, Libertarian-like. Efficient.

	Now I am not recommending PROUT. It's old, it hasn't seen much in the way of updates, and it's socialist in some very unhelpful ways.

	Yeah, tweet limit. I should have made it clearer what kind of damage I was talking about (https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/qkjpbd/pirate-bay-founder-peter-sunde-i-have-given-up … is probably the thing to read.)	leashless	0	0	1513308780	941511379856642048	https://twitter.com/leashless/status/941511379856642048			
	The Libertarian dream has precisely zero chance of working. The simplest argument against it is that an unprepared and heavily indoctrinated population will simply refuse to play ball. Monopoly regulation and environmental law are worse theoretical problems.

	If things stay harsh, however, there isn't enough Will in Team Present to rein in Team Future. And this, my dearest friends, is where the shit truly hits the fan. Because Team Future don't have a plan. They have *brutal* tactics, but no sense of what world they are building.	leashless	87	13	1513308609	941510664044122113	https://twitter.com/leashless/status/941510664044122113

	If America's governance recovers from the strain Trump has put on it then the Machinery of State kicks in, trims BTC down to something it can manage (probably with KYC regulations) and you get a safe Present/Future mix, 80%/20% or maybe a bit less. Life goes on: no revolution!	leashless	39	6	1513308292	941509333023588352	https://twitter.com/leashless/status/941509333023588352			
	And the but is, right now, nothing is for sale in BTC other than other currencies, and a few share-like instruments in companies that aren't actually doing any real trade yet. We have a huge slab of unhedged political risk tied up in our FutureCoin holdings. This is very unstable	leashless	54	10	1513308291	941509331757027328	https://twitter.com/leashless/status/941509331757027328			
bitcoin 	But a lot of people with a lot of money are performing a great hedge against a dollar price collapse brought on by political factors - you can imagine what a Trump impeachment followed by open insurrection in the South would do to bitcoin prices, can't you? Well, so can they. But	leashless	57	10	1513308291	941509330330882048	https://twitter.com/leashless/status/941509330330882048			
	But The Future shares a geography with The Present. The governments *own* The Present, and you can't just open The Future right in the middle of their turf without a dialogue. If America wasn't turning into a failed state, this massive Dollar Short wouldn't be remotely possible.	leashless	91	22	1513308290	941509328544190464	https://twitter.com/leashless/status/941509328544190464			
	Right now BTC is a currency. The *enormous* sell off of dollars to buy BTC is a currency bubble. It's not shares in a company: companies make things. BTC is the national currency of The Future, and people are shorting the Present to buy the FutureCoin. They're shorting status quo	leashless	160	68	1513308027	941508225479987202	https://twitter.com/leashless/status/941508225479987202			
	"And I don't mean this daffy consumer spending B2C or darkweb shit. I mean people have to be buying and selling oil and aeroplanes for BTC. You say ""but price volatility"" and I say ""I KNOW!"" Because if nobody's selling anything for BTC except dollars? Big trouble. Let me explain."	leashless	56	14	1513307941	941507860642615300	https://twitter.com/leashless/status/941507860642615300			
	Now, let's talk about Too Big To Fail. Dotcom bubble peaked around 10 trillion of value, 20x the BTC bubble. Consumer spending online wasn't enough to support a bubble of that size. BTC *has* to get industrial uses in supply chain to survive: it has to become a trade instrument.	leashless	94	25	1513307940	941507858977427457	https://twitter.com/leashless/status/941507858977427457			
	"I would say ""getting Napstered"" but most people who're BTC/ETH rich are *too young to have used Napster*. I can't even make an analogy they remember, because they haven't lost a great technology to regulation within living memory.

	If we were smart, right about now, somebody would put $100m in a bucket and start buying influence using DC lobbying firms, and whoever does that job at the UN, particularly the ITU. Those are the fights we have to win not to wind up as dead as Napster and The Pirate Bay by 2020.	leashless	136	34	1513307473	941505898173870080	https://twitter.com/leashless/status/941505898173870080			
	AH! You say, but BTC is anon, and zcash can blind transactions in any system with a gateway. Yep, you bet, right on. So there's the battle lines for the next five years: zeroprivacy vs. zcash. Use and abuse of zksnarks. Authoritarian vs. libertarian, all on very similar tech base	leashless	94	19	1513307404	941505609110900736	https://twitter.com/leashless/status/941505609110900736			
	But the great grandaddy of horrible problems blockchain can solve is terrorist and criminal financing. You ID people before you let them on the blockchain, and then you have a totally transparent payment map of the entire society. That's what The Powers want with blockchain.	leashless	118	33	1513307248	941504955818676226	https://twitter.com/leashless/status/941504955818676226			
	What do we offer at those tables? Well, here's how you get a seat at those tables: you solve a problem everybody wants solved, and that nobody else can solve. Supply chain financing is a really good fit for that problem. So is provenance of goods. So are remittance payments.	leashless	88	18	1513307248	941504954602344449	https://twitter.com/leashless/status/941504954602344449			
	And $500bn is a lot of money. It's the kind of money that can buy things like lobbyists and maybe fund some election campaigns. It's enough to be a sector, an industry with a voice and political influence. We start to buy our way into the negotiations of the real powers.	leashless	75	15	1513307116	941504404439650305	https://twitter.com/leashless/status/941504404439650305			
	So that's not happening. Instead, we co-opt forces. Big Tech starts selling braindamaged blockchain-lite. Banking flirts with it all. A lot of traders make a lot of money. The lawyers warm. Some of the trade people go hmm. That's a power base. Not much of one but we have friends.	leashless	65	12	1513307116	941504403051294720	https://twitter.com/leashless/status/941504403051294720			
	So let's examine the Full Vision around BTC. The economy goes 100% dark. Government can't tax. Welfare collapses, the military collapses, property rights define society, and the nerds inherit the earth. In this scenario we have 299 million new enemies, some with nuclear weapons.	leashless	79	12	1513306977	941503818268856322	https://twitter.com/leashless/status/941503818268856322			
	The internet goes through the napster years, then a winter, then the bittorrent years, then a winter, then Netflix and Spotify. That equilibrium holds. DRM in some areas, open formats in others, a sort of messy middle ground detent between future and past forms: a new balance.	leashless	102	18	1513306850	941503287496409088	https://twitter.com/leashless/status/941503287496409088			
	We now enter the special kind of hell reserved for innovators that must negotiate with The Great Leviathan. The old order wants many things, some good, some evil. But it holds all the cards that the innovators don't, and that's 95% of the economy and all the power. Mice and dinos	leashless	72	16	1513306850	941503286137540608	https://twitter.com/leashless/status/941503286137540608			
	The third thing: now that the regulators are in motion, they aren't going to stop moving. They'll keep going until they've created a world pretty much like the one we have. They are the forces of the status quo: not of *evil* but of stasis. BTC represents nearly violent change.	leashless	77	14	1513306478	941501726569521153	https://twitter.com/leashless/status/941501726569521153			
	"The second thing is that the regulators have an *amazing* array of tools at their disposal because people have been fleecing the public for centuries. Law evolves. Securities law, insider trading, anti money laundering etc. ""Token"" isn't a legal category so law gets to define it!"	leashless	55	12	1513306398	941501392610627585	https://twitter.com/leashless/status/941501392610627585

bitcoin 	It's a very valid question, but in the end the $ BTC value is the only thing that matters. You eventually have to move from that alt to Bitcoin. Every exchange is denominated in Bitcoin.

bitcoin 	Using USD is fine - just make sure that USD gain is more than $ BTC gained in USD over the holding period. Otherwise, you just sold your Bitcoin for an alt, and eventually you have to sell your alt back to Bitcoin. Then when you sell your Bitcoin for USD -> you get LESS usd.

	That will open up a setup for huge rally to start next week.. if we can close in upper 2.70s... wash most out over 5 days and end unchanged in price on week... worth keeping this in mind as we head to close..https://twitter.com/Bamabroker/status/941639852260495361 …	Bamabroker	13	1	1513339482	941640155244498944	https://twitter.com/Bamabroker/status/941640155244498944			
	"I think with very very high odds.. after I read twitter last night.. and the countless and countless tweets I read saying..

	natty is just a beast that a 4% drop is the same as SPX moving 10 points.. you have to position yourself with that view.. size wise.. or risk wise.. in your head... If a SPX move of 30+ is CRAZY to you... then that is NATTY 8% move..	Bamabroker	10	0	1513339236	941639124771012608	https://twitter.com/Bamabroker/status/941639124771012608			
	I say this every week.. and will do it again.... I DONT THINK ABOUT 90% OF TRADERS SHOULD TRADE NATTY... MOST WANT BIG GAIN BUT CANT TAKE THE 4% DAILY MOVES.. EVEN IF YOUR RIGHT..

	GLD will be up 10-15c since weds on the open.. and TLT up 20c.. as of right now.. I can't take 2 dime moves as a sign of anything...https://twitter.com/RG1144/status/941636291694874624 …	Bamabroker	7	0	1513338793	941637265821925378	https://twitter.com/Bamabroker/status/941637265821925378			
	What is crazy on Natty.. and I know this doesn't even seem possible.. and as I say on Natty.. She is a WILD beast.. but I wonder how many are aware of this... If Natty does move up to 2.78-2.80 by close.. NATTY ENDS GREEN ON WEEK...

	on natty.. again this has gone deeper than I expected clearly but as crazy as this sounds.. if we can break 2.74 today... and end up at 2.78-2.80... That would actually be very positive after the week it had.. and we would only be a Sunday night gap up from 2.90...

	Oil looking good... still like to see that 58 break today to confirm our move to 60+.. today... again.. as said at 55 a few weeks ago... at 62..
