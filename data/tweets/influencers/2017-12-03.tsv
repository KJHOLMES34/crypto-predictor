	Crypto can divide infinitely smaller. Just like gold did for us for 10,000 years. OTOH a debased currency (like the fiat regime we’ve had for 40 years) always fails to hold up an economy and leads to collapse.	woonomic	3	2	1512319430	937361746746073088	https://twitter.com/woonomic/status/937361746746073088

bitcoin 	Ride the early steep trajectory for 2-3 years, then roll the investment into new projects capable of climbing steeply. It’s a VC model. Returns that # Bitcoin offered in 2011-2013 are still available today, but there’s work involve to find the gems. /30	woonomic	80	21	1512275802	937178758070636544	https://twitter.com/woonomic/status/937178758070636544		#

	I suggest selecting just as a VC would. Vet the team, call them up, are they competent? Check their tech, read their source code, is the tech stack useful? How big can the market grow to? What are the token dynamics, is the token designed for high velocity or low? /28	woonomic	69	15	1512275728	937178446505103366	https://twitter.com/woonomic/status/937178446505103366

	That last slide was the top 125 outliers, this chart shows essentially the entire market.

bitcoin 	The data suggests by 2022, Bitcoin’s volatility will also be nearly as low as fiat FOREX.
