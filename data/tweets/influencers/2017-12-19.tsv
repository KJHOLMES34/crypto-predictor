	@ deadalnix any interest in eventually integrating what I suggest above?

bitcoin ethereum 	If bitcoin cash wants to go to multi-gigabyte blocks, I hope they add state root commitments, or at least require transactions to reference block number and txindex of prevouts they spend, and https://github.com/ethereum/research/wiki/A-note-on-data-availability-and-erasure-coding …; that way we can have strong light client verification	VitalikButerin	63	14	1513655597	942966035812048896	https://twitter.com/VitalikButerin/status/942966035812048896			
	Creating a blockchain that does 10k tx/sec is easy. Creating a blockchain that does 10k tx/sec while still maintaining other key properties of blockchains (decentralization, security, etc etc) is hard.

	Plasma chains are *a* solution (better than PoW sidechains; those let 51% of the sidechain miners steal your money); but not a perfect solution. Channel tech and sharding will also help.

ethereum 	Even if a node can process hundreds or thousands of tx/sec in a closed simulation, that does not imply that it can support a public blockchain that can process that much.

	"I don't discuss my trades, but that's not the point. This tweet is not about BCH. It's about the fact that everyone is focusing on ""Store of Value"" as a tagline and the reality is that it's not a store of value right now. Maybe it's a wealth transference mechanism?"

bitcoin 	Bitcoin holders don't really see Bitcoin as a Store of Value, but rather a vehicle for wealth creation.

	Also, I'm generally of the view that people need to take responsibility for their own investment decisions. Getting burned can be an important educational experience. But we'll probably see some lawsuits emerge as well, and let the courts decide where blame lies.	brian_armstrong	144	20	1513711853	943201993538936837	https://twitter.com/brian_armstrong/status/943201993538936837			
bitcoin 	The ICO thing has gotten beyond reckless.

	5/ Also, i'm not really a believer in splashy launches. Just soft launch, talk to customers, and keep making it better. Try lots of ideas until you find product market fit (meaning your customer retention curve doesn't decline to zero over time).	brian_armstrong	109	9	1513658264	942977222238879751	https://twitter.com/brian_armstrong/status/942977222238879751

	2/ Corollary: you're going to be embarrassed by your first release no matter how long you wait, because the first versions of most products suck, and expectations just get higher the longer you wait.	brian_armstrong	246	30	1513657803	942975288933101568	https://twitter.com/brian_armstrong/status/942975288933101568			
	1/ In 2018 we get to see which crypto projects actually *ship* now that they have all this money.

	I did not predict utopia. I *seriously* did not predict utopia.

	Not happening. The post-human elective genetics thing gets here long, long before you can get a racial powerrbase organized.

	Two big reasons: 1) Verifying a Zcash transaction is significantly slower than verifying secp256k1 signatures. 2) Zcash's indefinitely growing spent coins set inherently scales significantly worse than BTC's UTXO set; ugly decisions in the future like confiscation of coins.	peterktodd	31	7	1513713889	943210532806459393	https://twitter.com/peterktodd/status/943210532806459393			
	Equally, you know full well that proving that binaries were generated well in the past makes these kinds of attacks impractical - even the NSA doesn't have a time machine - so why the dismissal of auditing?

	Finally, why allow the firmware to be reprogrammed over the USB interface at all?

	Specifically, a good OTP write-protect design would be to have the bootloader compare the SHA256 hash of the firmware loaded off flash to a digest permanently burned into OTP.

	Good question! 1) Flash drives are complex: wear leveling, USB, etc. Easier to do w/ firmware. 2) Storing the firmware on the flash saves money; gets loaded w/ a bootloader in ROM. 3) Kanguru _should_ have used a one-time-programmable write-protect, but that's more $ than RSA.https://twitter.com/theartlav/status/942998403402928128 …	peterktodd	18	6	1513666808	943013059949481984	https://twitter.com/peterktodd/status/943013059949481984

	"The question ""what does scaling mean?"" is actually a really good one. Are you: 1) Adding trust/centralizing the system? 2) Small linear improvements, where something that used to cost k now costs, say, 0.5*k? 3) Changing the game entirely, e.g. changing a O(n^2) system to O(n)?https://twitter.com/dominiquefrnces/status/942894392402051072 …"	peterktodd	165	44	1513646126	942926312796311552	https://twitter.com/peterktodd/status/942926312796311552			
bitcoin 	Bitcoin could go up to a million and down to 1 dollar. This still holds true. It's not a $ BTC trend relationship...its a liquidity and denomination truth	VentureCoinist	25	3	1513724293	943254169640513536	https://twitter.com/VentureCoinist/status/943254169640513536			
bitcoin 	Yes you could, but you would still need to compare vs the $ BTC if the alt is only liquid in $ BTC While Bitcoin trends down post reversal, and you are making a good USD play but its bad in BTC terms...you have less USD when you switch to BTC for withdrawal sake.

bitcoin 	The only way to effectively increase your USD returns is through more $ BTC...not because Bitcoin is rising in value, but because its the only off ramp. Trend reversal wouldn't change this.
