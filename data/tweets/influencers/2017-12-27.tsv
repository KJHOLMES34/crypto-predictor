	"What about ""I do for us"" and ""we do for me""? I guess the latter is North Korea."	VitalikButerin	65	3	1514378748	945999152978079744	https://twitter.com/VitalikButerin/status/945999152978079744			
	Also, how would you describe someone who altruistically and self-sacrifically acts in ways specifically intended to increase other people's individual freedom? Individualist or collectivist? Or just a good guy?	VitalikButerin	741	92	1514378609	945998569684606976	https://twitter.com/VitalikButerin/status/945998569684606976			
	Am I missing something? Is there something inconsistent about believing that people should be free, but also valuing the common good, and hoping that people try to use their freedom for the common good at least sometimes?	VitalikButerin	1248	172	1514378464	945997960680230912	https://twitter.com/VitalikButerin/status/945997960680230912			
	In the first sense of the two words, it seems obvious that individualism is (generally) superior. In the second sense of the two words, it seems obvious that collectivism is superior.

	"So the ""individualism vs collectivism"" dichotomy sometimes puzzles me. I often see the two words used in two senses: 1. Individualism = individual freedom, collectivism = mutual restraint 2. Individualism = caring only about yourself, collectivism = caring about common good..."

ethereum 	On the Ethereum side, privacy is coming. https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/7mcibp/confidential_transactions_on_ropsten/ … just came out today. Account abstraction will plug the gas payment privacy leak. ZoKrates (https://github.com/JacobEberhardt/ZoKrates …) exists. Silver lining of price rises is more funding to make all of this happen.	VitalikButerin	65	16	1514377466	945993776580804609	https://twitter.com/VitalikButerin/status/945993776580804609

	It's about *creating new value through increasing efficiency*. Current gains in paper wealth don't represent growth in real value; in fact, with $10b/year PoW consumption quite the opposite.	VitalikButerin	36	1	1514377327	945993194310836224	https://twitter.com/VitalikButerin/status/945993194310836224			
ethereum 	Proof of stake is part of the solution; it makes ethereum a fundamentally different class of thing, which I think will be healthy in the long run.	VitalikButerin	451	38	1514376345	945989073390280704	https://twitter.com/VitalikButerin/status/945989073390280704

ethereum 	*All* crypto communities, ethereum included, should heed these words of warning. Need to differentiate between getting hundreds of billions of dollars of digital paper wealth sloshing around and actually achieving something meaningful for society.https://twitter.com/AmirPolyteknik/status/945693434500829184 …	VitalikButerin	8943	3942	1514375972	945987507941978112	https://twitter.com/VitalikButerin/status/945987507941978112

	If it was based on PoS, and the validators responsible for the attack all got slashed, then I would trust it *more*.	VitalikButerin	9	3	1514354576	945897769012568064	https://twitter.com/VitalikButerin/status/945897769012568064			
	Even the assumption that a selfish mining attack would ultimately harm everyone by making the price go down is an assumption about the social layer. Vlad's Casper research does an excellent job of *minimizing* social assumptions by relying only on explicit in-protocol penalties	VitalikButerin	44	6	1514350969	945882639583420416	https://twitter.com/VitalikButerin/status/945882639583420416			
	Exactly. PoW's security model relies on each miner or colluding group of miners having <50% (actually <23.21% because of https://arxiv.org/abs/1507.06183 ). Its ability to stay secure despite these assumptions being broken leans heavily on the social layer.	VitalikButerin	37	7	1514350884	945882284812414976	https://twitter.com/VitalikButerin/status/945882284812414976			
	"I don't think a sustained 51% attack ""never happening"" is a realistic assumption. I certainly would be hesitant to hold my coins in an SoV that relies on that assumption."	VitalikButerin	13	2	1514350692	945881478688149504	https://twitter.com/VitalikButerin/status/945881478688149504

	More seriously, when this happens, every miner has an incentive to fork the chain to grab the miners' fees for themselves.

	Oh no, most definitely not yelling at you, but LN is being oversold as a cure-all, so you'll take flak for that unless you take a balanced stance. Note also that the tenor of all BTC related conversations have, on average, shifted for the worse. Glad we're above that.	el33th4xor	5	0	1514353501	945893260953780224	https://twitter.com/el33th4xor/status/945893260953780224

	Descriptive names are great. But introducing undefined terms into a conversation isn't. Back on topic, given $100+ fees, what percent of users will be able to afford to open a channel? How much will a big exchange have to tie down in channels? Did anyone do any simulations?	el33th4xor	14	4	1514352385	945888578776829952	https://twitter.com/el33th4xor/status/945888578776829952			
	Sounds like you're referring to routing intermediaries. The comprehensive question is, who actually terminates a channel, given excessive fees? Do I create N channels to N counterparties, 1 to a bank+watchtower, or do I keep my coins on an exchange that has established channels?	el33th4xor	5	0	1514351550	945885076063178752	https://twitter.com/el33th4xor/status/945885076063178752

	Given high fees, people will have to connect to LN through bank-like custodians. And in fact, such custodians are a *required* part of the LN architecture, to guard against early termination attacks by watching the chain when a user is offline. LOL indeed!	el33th4xor	18	2	1514350223	945879512117628928	https://twitter.com/el33th4xor/status/945879512117628928

	LN, with its hubs and custodians, just replicates the old system using the new system, dropping all the advantages of the new one while being constrained by all of its pain points.	el33th4xor	25	6	1514345708	945860571370373120	https://twitter.com/el33th4xor/status/945860571370373120

	The way this natty pattern has evolved. I don't think 2.85 is a risk area anymore.
