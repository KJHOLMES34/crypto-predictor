	"I've never pronounced the feminine ""hairoine"". For me it's ""heeroine"" = ""Wonder Woman and co"", ""hairoine"" = ""very nasty drug""."	VitalikButerin	12	1	2018-02-10 05:04:08	962175326754193408	https://twitter.com/VitalikButerin/status/962175326754193408			
	Perhaps so, especially since new technologies make it easier to hold diversified baskets of issuers, including schemes like this: https:// ethresear.ch/t/collateraliz ed-debt-obligations-for-issuer-backed-tokens/525 …	VitalikButerin	5	2	2018-02-10 05:01:54	962174762150592513	https://twitter.com/VitalikButerin/status/962174762150592513			
	Yes, but as tech improves, *new opportunities* to spend more to get non-signaling results appear, and as wealth improves, it makes sense to take more and more of them. So cost disease by itself doesn't necessarily imply anything about signalling/results split.

	BTW even more pervasive and harmful than physics faults are social science faults, particularly completely disregarding (i) incentives, and (ii) the sheer instability of equilibria that any one of large-N parties could permanently break at any time if they ever feel like it.

	Basically, if something like Star Wars is not really going to be cerebral in any significant way *anyway*, does it *lose* anything by having asteroids packed so close together that there's no way the asteroid field would survive for more than four weeks?

	Most Austrian School economists don't reject economic models outright, they just say that no universal laws can be derived from them and that most other economic schools of thought ascribe too much value to them.

	Trump is the king of debt and you can’t renegotiate US government debt. He went BK many times and is only rich from his Dads money. Even running a casino he went BK.

	"Don't think it's entirely ""trust in math."" There's merit in @C1aranMurray 's ""trust in miners/devs"" position.

	... we're not there yet, whether for permissionless or permissioned models.(I'm no maximalist on either, btw.) But there is rapid development underway across the ecosystem writ large. I think it will eventually get blockchain costs far below the existing cost of trust.	mikejcasey	4	0	2018-02-10 23:39:37	962456046387236865	https://twitter.com/mikejcasey/status/962456046387236865			
	Yes of course blockchains incur cost and, yes, there's trust transfer to miners/devs. But that cost must be assessed against the massive cross-ledger reconciliation costs the economy currently carries. The potential for real-time, cross-entity transaction-processing tackles it...	mikejcasey	2	0	2018-02-10 23:35:57	962455124714106880	https://twitter.com/mikejcasey/status/962455124714106880			
	"I believe an evolving digital economy will create digital tokens for a wide array of more narrowly defined value exchange systems than just fiat-currency substitutes. So even if resolving double-spend is ""about it"" for blockchains, that'll be pretty useful.

	This was my recent critique of a certain Nobel prize-winning economist who writes for your paper's OpEd page. As smart these ppl are, they seem blind to the cost of trust.

	"I agree with @CaitlinLong_ . It's hard to fit some of these ideas into the pre-established assumptions of economic theory. I also don't think traditional economics knows how to measure the ""cost of trust,"" which is effectively what crypto and blockchain models try to tackle."	mikejcasey	14	2	2018-02-10 20:23:48	962406768344215552	https://twitter.com/mikejcasey/status/962406768344215552			@CaitlinLong_

	For instance, I bet Kim’s sister didn’t want to stand for the S Korean anthem.

	To be clear, I think South Korea’s President was naive to agree to a joint team. But that being water under the bridge, their prerogative, and largely inconsequential (unless we make it so), just stand and clap for the hosts, and honor their (perhaps misguided) hopes.	prchovanec	75	7	2018-02-10 22:32:54	962439257393713153	https://twitter.com/prchovanec/status/962439257393713153

	placing a trade in SPX with 10 points of risk or spot.. just throw your money out the window... your wasting you time... 50 points now was 5 2 weeks ago for any trade.. oil windows of 20c two weeks ago should be 2 dollars now.. can see this clear..

	IMPORTANT POST - VERY CAN SEE THIS CLEARLY AS WORK ON UPDATE... any trade you make... you need to have triple the normal time frame.. many sectors have liquidation patterns and calling any low during a liquidation move is impossible... you need to widen your risk and time NOW..
