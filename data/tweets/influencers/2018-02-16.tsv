	So for a Curation Business, start with a brand and keep your standards high.	naval	182	20	1518760036	964375606199599111	https://twitter.com/naval/status/964375606199599111			
	Nor can you select too many candidates (unless you’re good at burying your failures). It’ll cheapen your curation signal.	naval	51	4	1518760000	964375455573819393	https://twitter.com/naval/status/964375455573819393			
	What doesn’t work well is to just enter the business and assume that you’ll build a brand over time. You may never get enough high quality applicants.	naval	96	9	1518759940	964375205215846400	https://twitter.com/naval/status/964375205215846400			
	The hardest part is the initial branding. You can do it by bringing an existing brand from the outside, addressing a new vertical, an audacious new approach, or by creating unique content.	naval	171	20	1518759873	964374922632900608	https://twitter.com/naval/status/964374922632900608

	I don't know that they're being conned. I do think there's a lot of ambiguity that could be addressed. But that's my preference and the Comms team have now told me they try to do that. It would be interesting to survey 1000 coinbase holders of xrp for what made them buy	sytaylor	2	2	1518809883	964584677985177601	https://twitter.com/sytaylor/status/964584677985177601			
ripple 	When have I questioned your or anyone's integrity at ripple? This is a straight forward insult. I'm leaving this conversation now. It's been fun twitter.	sytaylor	1	0	1518808541	964579051456335872	https://twitter.com/sytaylor/status/964579051456335872			
ripple 	Strong opinions weakly held. I remain unconvinced of wrong doing, on any side here. Ripple remains compelling, with talented technical staff and an interesting value proposition. Me questioning the gap between perception and reality isn't wrong. What am I missing?	sytaylor	1	0	1518808323	964578136573825024	https://twitter.com/sytaylor/status/964578136573825024			
	So the coinbase analogy would be They say have lots of pr about large customer numbers. The media conflates customer numbers with price. I comment on that being a conflation. The coinbase fans online argue for why coinbase is good. I offer my views in return.	sytaylor	1	0	1518808012	964576834041106433	https://twitter.com/sytaylor/status/964576834041106433			
	I didn't bring it up on Twitter. I responded to people who questioned statements on a podcast where I and others suggested there was a gap between perception and reality of xrp usage. People then argued the benefits of xrp, i in turn raised questions.	sytaylor	0	0	1518807915	964576426061107200	https://twitter.com/sytaylor/status/964576426061107200

ripple 	"Do you think it's helpful to the long term credibility of an organization to use a crypto trader term like ""FUD"" or that there is a chrous of boos and hissing from a mob of Twitter accounts it someone is vaguely critical of any part of the ripple story or narrative?"	sytaylor	1	0	1518804992	964564167721148416	https://twitter.com/sytaylor/status/964564167721148416

ripple 	I believe a lot of people are testing ripple products. I also believe a lot of journos are getting confused about what's xrp and what isn't and that's a blurred line that suits people who are long xrp. Do you believe it doesn't suit people who hold xrp?	sytaylor	0	0	1518804332	964561397039403008	https://twitter.com/sytaylor/status/964561397039403008			
	I think I follow your rationale. I do think that individuals created something then lent it to a legal entity they had a controlling stake in. So it's not just the accountancy	sytaylor	0	0	1518804180	964560761002524674	https://twitter.com/sytaylor/status/964560761002524674

	Can I send you some of what I get? I think you have a lot happening between a release and the PR companies pushing it. I'm not out to get you. I'm trying to share how it comes across.

	So my challenge is - going into competition with central banks is interesting territory. Albeit one that they seem quite ambivalent to. And it it works it will be very interesting. I'm not against any of this by the way It's just how I perceive it	sytaylor	0	0	1518803876	964559485028139009	https://twitter.com/sytaylor/status/964559485028139009			
	My problem also goes away if I define it as fraud. If a bank made a book entry in my own account - crediting myself 1000 of any asset you choose. That bank committed fraud or is a central bank.	sytaylor	0	0	1518803811	964559213111455744	https://twitter.com/sytaylor/status/964559213111455744			
ripple 	Yes. And I'll admit it's ambiguous and varies. The original conversation was - I doubt xrp is used as much as some PR would suggest. The ripple community seems angry about that statement. I also doubt the legal status of xrp as a bearer asset. Recognise that it's a grey area	sytaylor	2	0	1518803572	964558209318088704	https://twitter.com/sytaylor/status/964558209318088704

	I for one wasn't aware of anyone using xrp in production and at scale. For the avoidance of doubt scale means more than 20% of the cross border transactions by value or volume.	sytaylor	4	1	1518803453	964557711290585092	https://twitter.com/sytaylor/status/964557711290585092

ripple 	I think you just summed up why I find the concept challenging from a financial services standpoint. That appears exactly like what they've done. Which makes it more of an IOU propped up by the believers. It looks to me like ripple* lent themselves a new asset they made up	sytaylor	1	0	1518803339	964557234041704449	https://twitter.com/sytaylor/status/964557234041704449			
	Yes the first one. And you can say that one was issued. But not the ones after. Different for xrp	sytaylor	1	0	1518803030	964555937154551811	https://twitter.com/sytaylor/status/964555937154551811			
bitcoin 	Agreed. The question is the mechanism and therefore the definition of how it came into being. You can say that no person issued a freshly mined Bitcoin. Harder to say for xrp.	sytaylor	1	0	1518802602	964554142642507776	https://twitter.com/sytaylor/status/964554142642507776			
	Xrp was pre mined / aka made up. Like an IOU or any debt issuance.	sytaylor	2	0	1518802438	964553455372300288	https://twitter.com/sytaylor/status/964553455372300288			
bitcoin ripple 	That would work if like bitcoin there were no human that instructed the pre mine of those tokens. Bitcoin has a clear network algorithm we can all see and understand how the Bitcoin comes into being. It's more akin to gold The ripple ledger isn't the same	sytaylor	3	0	1518802386	964553235712364550	https://twitter.com/sytaylor/status/964553235712364550			
	Brb need to go offline. I think the agree to disagree is the creation of the ledger and ownership of the majority of the asset that ledger creates is defacto issuance I can see why you disagree	sytaylor	0	0	1518796479	964528460977856512	https://twitter.com/sytaylor/status/964528460977856512			
ripple 	Which works IF you believe ripple is a complaint issuer of an asset. Which I think is a challenging position to take Therefore it's not functioning as bearer	sytaylor	0	0	1518796382	964528053656440832	https://twitter.com/sytaylor/status/964528053656440832

ripple 	Ripple as a network issues IOUs in return for fiat - much like PayPal would. Xrp is in effect issued by the dominant controller of the ripple network. Ripple labs inc. It's acting like a central bank and that raises real governance questions - that's not a red herring at all	sytaylor	0	0	1518796211	964527333498605568	https://twitter.com/sytaylor/status/964527333498605568			
ripple 	I've said before and I say again. For corporates wanting to avoid the banking system ripple is interesting. The concept of a natively digital asset is super interesting. But the creation and ownership structure of xrp isn't as simple as gold.	sytaylor	1	0	1518796048	964526650485563393	https://twitter.com/sytaylor/status/964526650485563393			
	It's more like a prospector found gold. Gave it to a VC backed company and that company holds a lot of (and profits from) it's use.	sytaylor	1	0	1518795982	964526375880273920	https://twitter.com/sytaylor/status/964526375880273920			
ripple 	That works great if I hold a ton of xrp. Which requires the asset becoming much more legitimate. But it's setup and ripple labs dominance scares off mainstream banks. Large corporations I can see it for. But I don't see a direct parallel with gold if it were gifted by founders	sytaylor	1	0	1518795934	964526174817923072	https://twitter.com/sytaylor/status/964526174817923072			
ripple 	No it is an IOU. That's exactly what it is. Unless ripple are a central bank. I exchange fiat for xrp and the only entity that settles xrp is ripple.	sytaylor	1	0	1518795617	964524842438414337	https://twitter.com/sytaylor/status/964524842438414337			
	Also paraphrasing what was said, and taking it out of context and using that as grounds to insist on an apology is an interesting strategy to convince someone to do something. I like the concept of a better faster cheaper swift. I'm not sold on xrp. I stand by that.	sytaylor	0	0	1518795545	964524540071211009	https://twitter.com/sytaylor/status/964524540071211009			
ripple 	"""nobody"" was not used as an absolute term. For the 100+ companies working with ripple you can cite 6 using xrp in pilot mode.

	I think consumers will go to wherever the user experience and brand is.

	I find it interesting that the one second I doubted my view here was the second it turned. Markets are really amazing.

	I did not expect spx to reach this level. I was looking for a huge rally this week into 2720 and a fail as I laid out last weekend in update but we are near 2760 now?!?!!	Bamabroker	14	1	1518802511	964553759224410117	https://twitter.com/Bamabroker/status/964553759224410117

	If we follow the normal path of 10% corrections. We should make a lower low on spx and nymot only hit -200. That is where I want to get long again.	Bamabroker	37	2	1518793648	964516585833627648	https://twitter.com/Bamabroker/status/964516585833627648			
	I would expect spx to drop 8-10% from here and yet nymot only hit -200. That is pretty much how every major LOW looks from a 10% drop. And yes I know. Everything things the lows are in. That is the entire point of the nymot move up.	Bamabroker	31	4	1518793489	964515918050201600	https://twitter.com/Bamabroker/status/964515918050201600			
	On the feb 9th lows. THE LOW. nymot makes a higher low at -150. This is how most all lows look when down. NOW TODAY. Spx drop 9-10%. Nymot hits -350. Extreme over sold. Nymot the rallies 450 points. That's today. What's next likely. 9% spx drop again. Nymot higher low.	Bamabroker	22	2	1518793414	964515604186173440	https://twitter.com/Bamabroker/status/964515604186173440			
	Where we are and what's coming. Imho. Jan 2016. Spx drops 9%. Nymot hits near -300. Very oversold. Over next 2 weeks nymot rallies 450 points to relieve oversold reading and make most everyone think lows are in. Nymot top Jan 25th.

	After calling for the move in rates in DEC at 2.35 to head to 2.90 and top... everyone talking rising rates now after the fact move is over... there are two 10 year rate targets... first is 2.53.. but there is a door to 2.35 again but that may involve something VERY bad to happen	Bamabroker	31	2	1518784914	964479950857428993	https://twitter.com/Bamabroker/status/964479950857428993

	One post tonight because yes I know this sounds crazy... but I expect to see SPX have a large down move to start soon... possible down 50 Friday that creates the HUGE weekly hammer and then follows through hard on Monday down... and TLT heads to 125 in 10-15 days..
