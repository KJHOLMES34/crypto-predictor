	@ Wolf_InTheWilds they totally circumvented the RRR hikes through shadow banking.	prchovanec	0	0	1452918798	688217438652006400	https://twitter.com/prchovanec/status/688217438652006400			@

	@ Wolf_InTheWilds go calculate the actual bank reserve ratio and you will see significant desterilization in 2009.	prchovanec	1	0	1452918666	688216884638908416	https://twitter.com/prchovanec/status/688216884638908416			@
	@ Wolf_InTheWilds 1) you are looking a RRR, but not the actual reserve ratio. 2) you are ignoring expansion of shadow banking	prchovanec	0	0	1452918578	688216515133374464	https://twitter.com/prchovanec/status/688216515133374464			@
	@ Wolf_InTheWilds starting in 2010, RRR was then gradually raised. BUT this was circumvented by rise of shadow banking.	prchovanec	0	0	1452918484	688216123225968642	https://twitter.com/prchovanec/status/688216123225968642			@
	@ Wolf_InTheWilds actual reserve ratio fell pretty starkly in 2009, excess reserves were erased and RRR was reduced somewhat to accommodate.	prchovanec	0	0	1452918394	688215742135681027	https://twitter.com/prchovanec/status/688215742135681027			@
	@ Wolf_InTheWilds more than the RRR, look at what happened to the actual reserve ratio, cuz there were excess reserves to start.	prchovanec	0	1	1452918327	688215463940116482	https://twitter.com/prchovanec/status/688215463940116482			@
	@PortlandCTA @ WorthWray well, the question was whether China was willing to follow US in Fed tightening, USD appreciation.	prchovanec	4	0	1452910467	688182495657918465	https://twitter.com/prchovanec/status/688182495657918465			@PortlandCTA @
	@PortlandCTA I think it's cuz people in bond markets only focus on one side of transaction (sale), don't follow macro use of proceeds.	prchovanec	0	0	1452910361	688182052739399680	https://twitter.com/prchovanec/status/688182052739399680			@PortlandCTA
	Yes. I explain why here: http://foreignpolicy.com/2015/01/25/why-chinas-u-s-treasury-sell-off-is-good-news/ …https://twitter.com/PortlandCTA/status/688180821023260673 …	prchovanec	6	3	1452910265	688181649972961280	https://twitter.com/prchovanec/status/688181649972961280			
	@PortlandCTA Not surprising at all. As I've written, China selling UST to make USD payments has no net effect on available demand for UST.	prchovanec	3	0	1452910176	688181274721189889	https://twitter.com/prchovanec/status/688181274721189889			@PortlandCTA
