bitcoin 	"well ok then. you are confusing people as to what you mean by saying ""bitcoin is the majority hashrate"" as if hashrate decides protocol then"	adam3us	23	0	1506901064	914635471824834560	https://twitter.com/adam3us/status/914635471824834560			
bitcoin 	if a miner doesnt mine the Bitcoin that user nodes run, they arent mining: hashrate falls, other miners become more profitable and that's it	adam3us	27	2	1506900988	914635152650842119	https://twitter.com/adam3us/status/914635152650842119

bitcoin 	unprofitable mining hurts that miner, it doesnt change Bitcoin. if you're not mining the Bitcoin users nodes are running, you're not mining.	adam3us	18	4	1506900384	914632622634000386	https://twitter.com/adam3us/status/914632622634000386
