bitcoin 	It's maybe $1 or $2 billion per day. This is tiny, but retailers only get orders from existing Bitcoin users, so volumes can grow in sync.	TuurDemeester	2	2	1504637220	905140222228353024	https://twitter.com/TuurDemeester/status/905140222228353024

	20/ This is why I suspect that most ICOs issuing utility tokens for use in an internal payment network need to go back to the drawing board.	TuurDemeester	139	27	1504636740	905138209713217536	https://twitter.com/TuurDemeester/status/905138209713217536			
	19/ But creating a walled garden with a newly issued, high overhead, free floating blockchain token - it just doesn’t make sense to me.	TuurDemeester	85	13	1504636728	905138159331233793	https://twitter.com/TuurDemeester/status/905138159331233793			
bitcoin 	20/ In sum, for retailers small and large, accepting Bitcoin could make sense given sufficient adoption, low fee tx, and market liquidity.	TuurDemeester	51	8	1504636703	905138053659987969	https://twitter.com/TuurDemeester/status/905138053659987969			
bitcoin 	19/ Bitcoin’s network, development, community, all have been growing since 2009 and would require hardly any extra effort from Amazon.	TuurDemeester	38	4	1504636682	905137966976307200	https://twitter.com/TuurDemeester/status/905137966976307200			
bitcoin 	18/ Bitcoin’s market might be (and probably will be) liquid enough to sustain instant USD conversions that Amazon needs to stay BTC neutral.	TuurDemeester	38	7	1504636670	905137914878861312	https://twitter.com/TuurDemeester/status/905137914878861312			
	17/ It opens up markets that already save and transact in BTC, especially digital goods buyers from Iran, India, Argentina, Venezuela....	TuurDemeester	53	9	1504636614	905137683072200704	https://twitter.com/TuurDemeester/status/905137683072200704			
bitcoin 	16/ Amazon accepting Bitcoin on the other hand, could make a lot more sense:	TuurDemeester	73	12	1504636592	905137588700409856	https://twitter.com/TuurDemeester/status/905137588700409856			
	15/ In sum, I don’t see the use of introducing massive friction by forcing a novel blockchain-based currency on customers: lose-lose prop.	TuurDemeester	71	6	1504636575	905137518659678208	https://twitter.com/TuurDemeester/status/905137518659678208			
	14/ All this would add to Amazon’s overhead, costs that would in the end be paid by its customers. And at what benefit?	TuurDemeester	35	4	1504636504	905137219823947776	https://twitter.com/TuurDemeester/status/905137219823947776			
	13/ AMZN could hold a large ABux defensive reserve - but that sucks for customers bc means the company could also manipulate the currency.	TuurDemeester	30	3	1504636493	905137172155682817	https://twitter.com/TuurDemeester/status/905137172155682817			
	12/ Attack vectors: A criminal could buy $10M worth of ABux, then drive up its value w_ borrowed money. I.e. create his own store discounts.	TuurDemeester	36	3	1504636459	905137029511602176	https://twitter.com/TuurDemeester/status/905137029511602176			
	11/ Amazon may also need to setup a KYC/AML compliance department, something that is now taken care of by the banks & credit card cos.	TuurDemeester	33	3	1504636448	905136986394161152	https://twitter.com/TuurDemeester/status/905136986394161152			
	10/ Because ABux floats, it would need to be hedged against - costing $$. Like how airlines have to hedge against oil price volatility.	TuurDemeester	32	4	1504636438	905136944350408705	https://twitter.com/TuurDemeester/status/905136944350408705			
	9/ Of course, if the ABux price rises, purchasing the token may be an attractive proposition. But think of it from Amazon’s point of view:	TuurDemeester	26	3	1504636429	905136903669862400	https://twitter.com/TuurDemeester/status/905136903669862400			
	8/ And then customers also would need to acquire ABux tokens, which means they’re charged exchange fees and are exposed to high volatility.	TuurDemeester	38	3	1504636412	905136834795245569	https://twitter.com/TuurDemeester/status/905136834795245569			
	7/ The cost of ABux is carried by the users, who are charged transaction fees, and paid out to ABux miners. More friction.	TuurDemeester	35	4	1504636400	905136785277280258	https://twitter.com/TuurDemeester/status/905136785277280258			
	6/ First, by choosing blockchain, the ABux payment network becomes very expensive, as every node stores a complete backup of the database.	TuurDemeester	45	4	1504636386	905136725487439872	https://twitter.com/TuurDemeester/status/905136725487439872			
	"5/ Now imagine if Amazon launched its own free floating decentralized blockchain token, ""ABux""."	TuurDemeester	28	3	1504636346	905136559216881664	https://twitter.com/TuurDemeester/status/905136559216881664			
	4/ Amazon’s tokens are centralized (ledger is on company servers), and pegged to USD. Both measures ensure a smooth customer experience.	TuurDemeester	41	5	1504636320	905136446872444929	https://twitter.com/TuurDemeester/status/905136446872444929			
	3/ Another is known as Amazon Credit, and you can earn it via its Mechanical Turk program or by selling products as an Amazon vendor.	TuurDemeester	38	3	1504636292	905136328756658176	https://twitter.com/TuurDemeester/status/905136328756658176			
	2/ First of all, Amazon already has tokens! One is called Amazon Coin and you can buy 10 for $0.98.pic.twitter.com/2UvO8isFeO	TuurDemeester	47	8	1504636267	905136225014751232	https://twitter.com/TuurDemeester/status/905136225014751232
