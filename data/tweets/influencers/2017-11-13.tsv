	The censorship quote was widely misinterpreted. Should be read in contrapositive: we *cannot* guarantee the good guys are in charge, therefore censorship is dangerous.	VitalikButerin	41	4	1510538200	929890726778941440	https://twitter.com/VitalikButerin/status/929890726778941440

bitcoin 	Clearly, it’s not Bitcoin. There is no social consensus that Bitcoin Cash is Bitcoin, not yet anyways. *Maybe* one day there will be but that’s clearly not the case today.

	I disagree. I think they should reduce the block size to 350k, as proposed by @lukedashjnr.
