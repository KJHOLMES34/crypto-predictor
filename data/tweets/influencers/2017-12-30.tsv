bitcoin 	That’s a fair point. The people who invested in Ponzi got 30 cents on the dollar back. I think the writer’s point is that is that the Bitcoin whales will be fine, but the Calcutta taxi drivers putting their life savings into it will lose most of their money.	dgwbirch	0	0	1514672948	947233116829208577	https://twitter.com/dgwbirch/status/947233116829208577

	True. And I know such distinctions are important. But it feels like semantics when my point is that CBs have at times struggled to contain the damage done by banks' off-balance sheet credit expansions.	mikejcasey	2	0	1514665372	947201341994209281	https://twitter.com/mikejcasey/status/947201341994209281			
	But there WAS inflation B4 housing burst. It was asset inflation. All aided by banks' creation of de facto money. CBs didn't know how/whether to rein it in. Same now - though, currently, inflation is limited to financial assets, not houses, so not nearly as big problem socially.	mikejcasey	1	0	1514663828	947194864797736962	https://twitter.com/mikejcasey/status/947194864797736962			
	I know. But I'm suggesting that off-balance sheet financial engineering can let banks escape even those reserve constraints. Before 08 crisis, tens of trillions in CDS, CDOs and synthetic CDOs had been created. Their collateral treatment was so liberal they were akin to money.	mikejcasey	2	0	1514661646	947185714684399617	https://twitter.com/mikejcasey/status/947185714684399617

	True, but in the interbank market, private banks have from time to time created alternative forms of money. Tri-party repos, AAA-rated CDOs -- these at different times have taken on the quality of money. (With disastrous consequences).	mikejcasey	1	0	1514649401	947134354932760578	https://twitter.com/mikejcasey/status/947134354932760578

	This pedantic distinction matters, because a chain of blocks can be usefully made at the low level with an series of incrementally extended trees (like MMRs).

	The important distinguishing feature of a blockchain is being able to verify you have the complete set of something. git usually doesn't qualify b/c of how people use it (assumed that there are many forks), but for some usecases, even git is loosely speaking a blockchain.https://twitter.com/whitequark/status/946886702932557824 …	peterktodd	44	9	1514641544	947101400944615429	https://twitter.com/peterktodd/status/947101400944615429

bitcoin 	Then how come Satoshi's coins and Bitcoins burned forever count towards # Bitcoin Circulating Supply? MCap should be lower by at least 15% for Bitcoin if that's your logic.	ToneVays	0	0	1514669255	947217627742724099	https://twitter.com/ToneVays/status/947217627742724099		#	
bitcoin ripple 	That Makes no sense, in that case we should drop the Market Cap of # Bitcoin by 15% at least cause Satoshi's coins have a smaller probability of moving than the current Ripple shit they claim is locked away cause they say so.

	It's similar to the reason it's in an airline's interest to sell you a cheap seat at the last minute, even if it's below their average cost. Their costs are mostly fixed, whether you pay for the seat or they fly with it empty.	prchovanec	5	0	1514596182	946911139140685824	https://twitter.com/prchovanec/status/946911139140685824			
	So you can argue whether the government should pay, in the first place, for USPS to have all that capacity. But once it's there, better to have a paying customer use it, even at a (reduced) loss.	prchovanec	3	0	1514596062	946910634867920898	https://twitter.com/prchovanec/status/946910634867920898			
	Of course it's cheaper for Amazon than the alternative. If it wasn't, Amazon would pay for the next cheaper alternative, USPS would have lower capacity utilization, and more costs would end up being borne by the federal government.	prchovanec	15	3	1514595970	946910248652148736	https://twitter.com/prchovanec/status/946910248652148736			
	Both of you are actually right. Amazon benefits from subsidized USPS infrastructure, but that cost would exist with or without Amazon. Having Amazon as a paying customer reduces the net subsidy born by the government.	prchovanec	22	5	1514595856	946909769503248384	https://twitter.com/prchovanec/status/946909769503248384
