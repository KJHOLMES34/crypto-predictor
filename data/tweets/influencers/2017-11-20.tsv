	OK, http://www.bankingtech.com/76761/moscow-exchange-adopts-t2-settlement/ … does a better job. It seems to be centered around capital efficiency - for example, it allows trading on multiple venues without having to somehow hold your assets on multiple venues at the same time.

	The arguments that *do* make sense are: 1. Something about capital efficiency (though even there I'm still not quite seeing the need outside of leverage trading) 2. For whatever weird reasons finance is not yet fully digital, and in time this will be solved on its own.	VitalikButerin	12	3	1511165879	932523404715888641	https://twitter.com/VitalikButerin/status/932523404715888641

	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guided_tour_puzzle_protocol … This relies on having a set of servers that must be accessed. Who runs the servers?

	OK, so in this particular case people want synthetic assets because they want a higher than 1:1 ratio (or negative ratio) of exposure to capital, and so settlement is only required upon joining and leaving. Makes sense. Still leaves all the other T+3 industries though :)	VitalikButerin	4	4	1511162791	932510450868088832	https://twitter.com/VitalikButerin/status/932510450868088832			
	This is not about blockchains, this is about generalizeable results from BFT theory. BFT theory states that even with strong network synchrony assumptions, a 51% attack can break consensus.

	Yes, but it's all digital bits. Reassigning ownership in electronic records is nearly costless. So why *not* reassign ownership 80000 times per second?	VitalikButerin	3	3	1511161344	932504380258992128	https://twitter.com/VitalikButerin/status/932504380258992128

	There is a difference between conscious exclusion and difficulty in finding. That is why event organizers need to go beyond inviting the always invited.

	Sorry, I read 95% as meaning 95%. We agree there needs to be more representation. There also should be time spent to find the 'diamonds in the rough'. Most event planners look to other events to find their speakers. It is incestuous. We start 11 months in advance to get diversity	JimMarous	3	0	1511191732	932631839738646529	https://twitter.com/JimMarous/status/932631839738646529			
	Geoffrey: Exactly. We have sponsors who do get on stage but they need to meet the same criteria as others. They need to submit a video of them presenting and can not sell on stage. Some hire speakers who they sponsor.	JimMarous	0	0	1511191296	932630010132942848	https://twitter.com/JimMarous/status/932630010132942848			
	We have an event that will draw close to 2,000 financial services executives. Sponsors are not provided stage time because they are sponsors. We limit vendor/sponsor attendance to less than 20% (vs. 50% at most events). 50% of main stage speakers are women.

	Liz, you don't need to give sponsors stage time. It is a lazy/easy way to run an event. If it is a good event, planned enough in advance, sponsors win without being on stage. You also avoid sales pitches which are disasterous.	JimMarous	0	0	1511190960	932628599911350273	https://twitter.com/JimMarous/status/932628599911350273

	Totally for fresh perspectives and diversity. But wanting 95% women and focusing on the lesser known does not help anyone. The way lesser known speakers get exposure is to be part of larger events where the bigger names speak. Like the unknown co-star who kills it in a big movie.

	Tough to pay for travel (or get an audience) if event is filled with speakers that don't have exposure. People select events based on who they know is speaking (not gender). The difference between a Hollywood hit and an art film. Most events aren't non-profits.	JimMarous	3	0	1511190055	932624803974012929	https://twitter.com/JimMarous/status/932624803974012929			
	An event we run asks for people willing to submit a proposal with a video of them speaking. Name recognition is desired for the top 10 speakers, all others are selected on quality and diversity. 5 of top 10 are women. 40% of rest are. It's good business.

	I agree that being 'forced' to put people on stage due to sponsorship or some other reason many times ends up as a less qualified speaker.

	If you ask most devs, they are fine with a block size increase at some point. But it's better to scale offchain first as scaling onchain reduces decentralization and that's something you can't undo.

	the monthly storage growth comes from 24x6x30x2MB = 8.6GB/month. plus blocks are often a bit faster than 10mins because of difficulty growth, and it can go above 2MB as far as 2.2-2.3MB depending on transaction types, 10GB/mo is plausible mid-term.	adam3us	0	0	1511172421	932550841697013760	https://twitter.com/adam3us/status/932550841697013760			
	indirectly segwit does reduce UTXO bloat, because it reduces a negative externality incentivising splitting transactions into more dust rather than consolidating. (That's why sigs are weighted 1/4 in segwit to reduce the cost of spending inputs closer to cost of creating outputs)	adam3us	1	0	1511171209	932545759089741826	https://twitter.com/adam3us/status/932545759089741826			
	well they are busy with customer service, web experience and onboarding users, and have architectural issues that may make it harder. but that does not mean they get to externalise costs, more efficient tx even pay for itself, many companies are burning > $100k/mo fees needlessly	adam3us	3	0	1511171045	932545073186856960	https://twitter.com/adam3us/status/932545073186856960			
	unfortunately, it does not reduce data directly. pruning mode helps though the loss of local access is an issue in some scenarios. there are more space optimisations possible and moving smartphones and < $1000 transactions to lightning should help a lot next year as LN is netted.	adam3us	3	0	1511170845	932544231083794432	https://twitter.com/adam3us/status/932544231083794432			
	some of your own comments during NYA however were obtuse, even misrepresentations of basic facts.

	otherwise it's like demanding removing emissions standards, while not bothering to tune the engine (so it's misfiring heavily), having their handbrake locked on, not plugging the hole in their fuel tank. but threatening to blow up the economy because they need to use more fuel.	adam3us	11	0	1511170095	932541084890263552	https://twitter.com/adam3us/status/932541084890263552

	but new nodes are simply sending around >= 2MB blocks once everyone is upgraded. i hear bitfinex is upgrading soon, others will follow in time. if some services and wallets are really slow to upgrade, users may switch to better maintained services with cheaper/faster payments.	adam3us	16	2	1511167067	932528385326272513	https://twitter.com/adam3us/status/932528385326272513			
	the reason you can do this without breaking compatibility with old pre-segwit nodes, is because for old un-upgraded nodes that only understand 1MB blocks, nodes make a special old block serialisation, which omits signatures and *that* is < 1MB. a bit confusing, but it works great	adam3us	12	0	1511166940	932527853744345089	https://twitter.com/adam3us/status/932527853744345089			
	well transactions space is about 2/3 taken by signatures, and with segwit the signature weight is 1/4 so 1/3+1/4*2/3=1/2 so you can serialise about 2x as many tx in a block. the actual transactions are serialised normallly (tx,sig),(tx,sig),... in the block so it's really 2MB.	adam3us	24	4	1511166796	932527250091773953	https://twitter.com/adam3us/status/932527250091773953

	An asset that's volatile on any time scale is not a good SoV for people who have funding needs on that time scale. And for value measured in USD, Tethers hold theirs. You are outclassed in this discussion: I implied nothing about USD and you missed the sarcasm about Tether.	el33th4xor	1	0	1511189557	932622717060337664	https://twitter.com/el33th4xor/status/932622717060337664			
	No. SoV requires either stable utility or predictability. A high performing but volatile stock doesn't make a good SoV. Nor do hedge instruments. The latter two possess great characteristics, for a spec investment or for portfolio insurance, not for a Store of Value.	el33th4xor	3	0	1511179999	932582628347260928	https://twitter.com/el33th4xor/status/932582628347260928

	Agreed, but if all you've got in BTC is a 1% bet that fluctuates in value, what you have is a speculative investment, not a store of value. Hence the original point.	el33th4xor	2	0	1511161021	932503028489445376	https://twitter.com/el33th4xor/status/932503028489445376			
	"BTW, I'm not saying that BTC is a ""bad investment,"" by any stretch. I'm pointing out that to be considered a SoV in most of the world, an asset has to provide utility or predictability. BTC has tremendous upside as a spec investment. Not the same thing as an SoV."	el33th4xor	2	0	1511153712	932472372313116673	https://twitter.com/el33th4xor/status/932472372313116673
