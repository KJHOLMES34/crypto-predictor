	You still have to use on-chain txs to open channels, and nodes will go offline and you will need to close on-chain. There will be miner fees for all of these on-chain txs. LN is secured by the underlying blockchain, you have to go to the chain to resolve disputes.	starkness	12	1	2018-01-13 05:33:40	952035896240390144	https://twitter.com/starkness/status/952035896240390144

	I don't think so. Not if its within the risk parameters for an investor.

	I have an investing portfolio for that reason + a percentage of the portfolio that goes to trading. If that trading portfolio can earn me more $ BTC than it loses, it is beating the market.

	I was talking about lowering risk for that segment, and one way I think you can do that is by choosing coins that have a utility with the current system.

	Instead, we should be making it clear that they will lose, immediately, at the conventional level, and that they will face US forces no matter where they poke the NATO periphery. But no.
