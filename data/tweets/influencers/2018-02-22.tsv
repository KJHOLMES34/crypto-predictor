	the payments per transaction graph on https:// transactionfee.info/charts/ is pretty useful - quite a bit more payments per day would be achievable if that average were increased via more batching. and batching can help privacy and fungibility via coinJoin as well as being cheaper.	adam3us	5	1	1519319100	966720492219588608	https://twitter.com/adam3us/status/966720492219588608			
bitcoin 	One could have a look at the web estimators, Bitcoin core estimator and the still maintained wallets.

bitcoin 	9/ Other resources: “Simple Schnorr Multi-Signatures with Applications to Bitcoin” by Gregory Maxwell, Andrew Poelstra, Yannick Seurin, Pieter Wuille ( @pwuille ), Jan 1018: https:// bitcoincore.org/en/2017/03/23/ schnorr-signature-aggregation/ … http:// Bitcoin.org blog: https:// bitcoincore.org/en/2017/03/23/ schnorr-signature-aggregation/ …	CremeDeLaCrypto	18	2	1519337309	966796866670088193	https://twitter.com/CremeDeLaCrypto/status/966796866670088193			@pwuille

	7/ In terms of privacy, the advantage of Schnorr signatures is that multi-sig txs are indistinguishable from “standard” single-sig txs—also, an aggregated Schnorr multi-sig does not reveal individual public key inputs (participants in multi-sig contract)	CremeDeLaCrypto	7	2	1519337191	966796370316161024	https://twitter.com/CremeDeLaCrypto/status/966796370316161024			
	6/ In terms of efficiency, the big benefit is smaller transactions—which means lower storage and computation costs. Important because it lowers transaction fees for users and minimizes resource requirements for network participants (e.g. full nodes)	CremeDeLaCrypto	13	1	1519337175	966796302565629954	https://twitter.com/CremeDeLaCrypto/status/966796302565629954

	4/ This concept can be extended with MuSig to aggregate signatures across multiple UTXOs. The former helps us achieve 1 signature *per UTXO*, the latter could go further and help achieve *1 signature per transaction*	CremeDeLaCrypto	5	1	1519337148	966796189046747136	https://twitter.com/CremeDeLaCrypto/status/966796189046747136

	2/ In particular, Shnorr signatures have “native multi-signature” support, meaning that multiple signatures needed to spend a UTXO can be aggregated into a single signature—particularly helpful given size of signature data (see images) pic.twitter.com/wTry52uRYs	CremeDeLaCrypto	12	2	1519337055	966795798368337920	https://twitter.com/CremeDeLaCrypto/status/966795798368337920			
	1/ One such innovation is Schnorr signatures. Aside from being easy to compute and considered highly secure, Schnorr signatures (and Schnorr-based MuSig) derive most benefits from their aggregation capabilities: https:// twitter.com/CremeDeLaCrypt o/status/966794879526256640 …	CremeDeLaCrypto	99	29	1519336998	966795561364942848	https://twitter.com/CremeDeLaCrypto/status/966795561364942848

	It doesn't really matter whether they would or not, because absent a constitutional amendment, such a law would almost certainly be struck down by the courts. https:// twitter.com/marcorubio/sta tus/966578411165532162 …	prchovanec	3	1	1519288998	966594234533888000	https://twitter.com/prchovanec/status/966594234533888000			
	Finally the US economy is solid enough for the risk-adjusted opportunity cost of holding a 10-year Treasury bond to come back to 3%.

	The clear answer, from CPAC at least, is yes. The rest of us in the conservative movement need to say a resounding NO. https:// twitter.com/jaynordlinger/ status/966504849939550208 …	prchovanec	6	3	1519288013	966590101135360001	https://twitter.com/prchovanec/status/966590101135360001			
	My point? Movements in US shale output, both up and down, have been driven a lot more by the impact of real demand on prices than by cost of capital, in the form of interest rates.	prchovanec	2	1	1519264801	966492744330903552	https://twitter.com/prchovanec/status/966492744330903552			
	To be honest, I haven't followed Chinese oil consumption patterns during and after the latest stimulus, to get a sense of their effect on global oil prices. I should.	prchovanec	0	0	1519264649	966492107849441280	https://twitter.com/prchovanec/status/966492107849441280			
	Well, actually, all this unfolded before the pre-Party Congress stimulus. In fact, the stimulus was in part a response to the 2014-15 slowdown I'm talking about.	prchovanec	0	0	1519264571	966491780140052480	https://twitter.com/prchovanec/status/966491780140052480			
	When expectations of future Chinese demand growth faltered, so did the oil price. You can look at the demand downgrades from IEA at the time, they coincide.	prchovanec	4	3	1519264470	966491357589090304	https://twitter.com/prchovanec/status/966491357589090304			
	There's no doubt that low rates did enable a lot of shale drilling. But for several years, rising US shale output was being absorbed by rising China demand (oil that US would have imported was being redirected to meet Chinese demand). Hence oil price remained >$100.	prchovanec	1	2	1519264409	966491099719086080	https://twitter.com/prchovanec/status/966491099719086080			
	Oil prices began their steep decline in June 2014. By this point, 10-year UST had already fallen below 2.7%. Oil prices reached their bottom in January 2016 (amid a stock sell-off triggered by new China concerns). At that point, 10-year UST was at 2% and falling rapidly.	prchovanec	2	2	1519264183	966490154461351936	https://twitter.com/prchovanec/status/966490154461351936			
	It was Chinese oil consumption growth falling short of expectations that punctured oil prices. Evident from both the timing and from tanker traffic patterns. UST yields hit 3% only briefly, 6 months before oil fell. Oil continued to fall even as UST rates fell to all-time lows. https:// twitter.com/spomboy/status /966066525663825920 …	prchovanec	11	7	1519263973	966489269849092096	https://twitter.com/prchovanec/status/966489269849092096

	Was clear at highs I could see some weakness and spx should start to weaken. But this doesn't look crash like.

	We are likely looking at stops runs and grind into Friday and a close in the 2700 area which opens up the big big move next week on Monday and Tuesday.	Bamabroker	13	1	1519319369	966721617916317697	https://twitter.com/Bamabroker/status/966721617916317697			
	One leading area now at multi hour lows. See if spx starts to fail here soon. Next hour. If spx ends red today would be brutal. Not seeing any signs of spx to go red today yet.

	50 day Ma and middle BB both at 2730 area. Markets are testing that from underneath here on spx. Almost like wanting to confirm again another failure. This is a lot of backtesting.

	Watch oil. Is ahead of spx. Oil seems to have worse liquidity issues than spx. May go red and break down before spx does.	Bamabroker	26	2	1519313712	966697893351616513	https://twitter.com/Bamabroker/status/966697893351616513			
	While usdjpy is just getting blown up. Carry trade being destroyed and a clear sign of massive amounts of liquidity leaving the system.

	Notice how oil and spx are trading together now and nothing matters to each. This is confirmation that everything is now a liquidity trade.	Bamabroker	34	5	1519312600	966693228266311680	https://twitter.com/Bamabroker/status/966693228266311680

	Once again. Dollar gets smashed to save spx. But rates then start going straight up as they just started which will then circle back later and crush spx. This is beyond self defeating.	Bamabroker	43	4	1519310635	966684988161888256	https://twitter.com/Bamabroker/status/966684988161888256

	Also when they smash the dollar they create inflation and rates go up which then circles back and crushes spx. At some point the spx needs to be able to function and get out of this feedback loop. This can't last. Beyond unhealthy. https:// twitter.com/bamabroker/sta tus/966678340538126336 …	Bamabroker	33	7	1519309132	966678681337901056	https://twitter.com/Bamabroker/status/966678681337901056			
	This is becoming self defeating. They smash the dollar to fix spx. But when they smash the dollar Europe goes straight down. Dax is down almost 10% again and headed to lows.	Bamabroker	30	8	1519309051	966678340538126336	https://twitter.com/Bamabroker/status/966678340538126336
