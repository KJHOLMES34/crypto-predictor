ethereum 	Agree! Hence why ethereum provides it at low level via gas, and at high level via decidable langs like http://github.com/ethereum/viper	VitalikButerin	3	2	1495966802	868773855246008320	https://twitter.com/VitalikButerin/status/868773855246008320

	It can only rule out classic of bugs that have to do with decidability. So the two questions are equivalent.	VitalikButerin	3	1	1495963066	868758183845650432	https://twitter.com/VitalikButerin/status/868758183845650432			
	The main ones that do are unbounded-length loops, where contract gets stuck because cost to execute next operation exceeds block gas limit	VitalikButerin	4	2	1495963022	868758001527668737	https://twitter.com/VitalikButerin/status/868758001527668737
