	1/mo in the *normal case*. But in channel-based sys, systemic risks (eg. attackers attacking every channel at once) become super important	VitalikButerin	3	2	1504451324	904360518047211520	https://twitter.com/VitalikButerin/status/904360518047211520

	Correct, BCH has low demand at present. I am talking about how to best handle the high-demand scenario.	VitalikButerin	7	2	1504435875	904295721570009088	https://twitter.com/VitalikButerin/status/904295721570009088			
	False, in a very meaningful sense. Seehttps://twitter.com/vitalikbuterin/status/896917191035019266 …	VitalikButerin	12	3	1504435817	904295475834171392	https://twitter.com/VitalikButerin/status/904295475834171392

	Correct. The fee level has to do with the ability to write. Full node cost has to do with the ability to read.	VitalikButerin	35	5	1504432719	904282483730022401	https://twitter.com/VitalikButerin/status/904282483730022401			
	The only behaviors available to *users* are reading and writing. Reading = running a node, writing = sending txs.	VitalikButerin	13	4	1504430632	904273730980990976	https://twitter.com/VitalikButerin/status/904273730980990976			
	Miners are not even a very relevant actor here; their only role in fee economics is as a sorting algorithm.	VitalikButerin	14	5	1504430536	904273325777715200	https://twitter.com/VitalikButerin/status/904273325777715200			
	Fee market seems like a very volatile one, lots of ups *and* downs.	VitalikButerin	4	2	1504430479	904273087746777089	https://twitter.com/VitalikButerin/status/904273087746777089			
	"The ""profit"" of running a node is the ability to verify transactions."	VitalikButerin	55	9	1504430380	904272672120606720	https://twitter.com/VitalikButerin/status/904272672120606720			
	Arguably, its utility to the former *protects* it against those who wish to challenge it because of the latter.	VitalikButerin	41	1	1504424571	904248307228311552	https://twitter.com/VitalikButerin/status/904248307228311552			
	The internet gets used by governments and bankers every day. But it also allows common people massively democratized access to information.	VitalikButerin	91	9	1504424543	904248189074722816	https://twitter.com/VitalikButerin/status/904248189074722816

	Fees are now 100x higher, so should wait for cost of a node to increase 100x before letting fees increase more.	VitalikButerin	86	17	1504424011	904245961446260741	https://twitter.com/VitalikButerin/status/904245961446260741			
	In this case, I think the correct principle is: cost of sending a tx and cost of running a node should rise at the same rate.	VitalikButerin	82	13	1504423984	904245846291746816	https://twitter.com/VitalikButerin/status/904245846291746816			
	"In general, harm from risks is superlinear, so if you must choose risks then spreading allocation is wise. Cf. ""everything in moderation"""	VitalikButerin	40	10	1504423920	904245579210907648	https://twitter.com/VitalikButerin/status/904245579210907648
