bitcoin 	This is often quite nuanced. For example, I consider Theymos's moderation policies on /r/bitcoin absolutely deplorable, but if the subreddit had been called /r/lounge_of_theymos the whole time instead, then it would be 100% totally ok.

	It's far simpler and far more effective to close a security hole, or to forbid categories of governance decision, when one can do so, than to worry about the probabilities and motivations of possible attackers of an open security hole, or deciders of decisions left open.

ethereum 	"ERP has no reliable or secure way to verify the supposedly required ""real"" names, nor to map them to social media nyms, nor to securely map these to the impacted Ethereum addresses.

	Community norms should forbid expanding the scope of software upgrades to include making particular legal and accounting decisions to modify balances.

bitcoin 	"The main improvement comes from limiting the scope for decision-making: e.g. Bitcoin, which, since last summer's dispute with the ""Big Arguers"", who wanted the blockchain to do more, has narrowed its goals for the blockchain, pushing retail payments to a different layer."

	Security has a concept called attack surface: the more kinds of exposures, the greater the attack surface.
