	Did boredom and dissatisfaction from art community engender a quantum leap into abstract, fearing sinking into sentimentality and repetition. Would Renaissance artists have leapt into abstract if they had the idea?

	But it illustrates how minimally reality can be represented - to the point of abstraction - to work on an unconscious level; validating, IMO, the idea that representational fidelity can be ignored when creating art.	maxkeiser	6	1	1518207129	962056546589974528	https://twitter.com/maxkeiser/status/962056546589974528

	Am I? Or are you hiding in a hole of delusion? If you truly loved your children you would be armed to the teeth. Even during the Renaissance - the most loving era in history - everyone was armed (sabers, swords) and true gentlemen and ladies proudly displayed their armaments.	officialmcafee	49	3	1518167233	961889209282908160	https://twitter.com/officialmcafee/status/961889209282908160

	Do you believe that leaving the planet we will also leave behind our animal selves? For every act of love, grace, charity, tenderness - there are equal acts of hatred, jealousy, greed, hostility. We are a mixed bag and have always been. Not being armed is believing in illusion.	officialmcafee	5	2	1518166773	961887279181680641	https://twitter.com/officialmcafee/status/961887279181680641			
	It saddens me that you don't own and carry weapons. Being unarmed seems to demonstrate either a disregard for the fragile nature of culture's veneer, or a total ignorance of it.

	I shared an article from somebody who documented their experience trying to use #IOTA . Your time would be better spent helping new users avoid these difficulties rather than pretend they don’t exist.

	It does show how minimally reality can be represented. I don't think that necessarily means representational fidelity can be entirely ignored as with modern art. The limits of how little fidelity can be kept and still have meaning is a great question.	jimmysong	3	0	1518207776	962059262108119040	https://twitter.com/jimmysong/status/962059262108119040			
	The abstraction in this case has clear and unambiguous meaning. The artist was able to capture reality well, even if it was abstract.

	In fact, a wider trader deficit virtually forces China to finance the debt by saddling them with that many more dollars. That’s how the balance of payments works.	prchovanec	1	0	1518140663	961777768961921024	https://twitter.com/prchovanec/status/961777768961921024

	Right, I’m not predicting trade deficit must match capital inflows. I’m saying the equation (including reserve accumulation) has to match. And it doesn’t matter if the actors understand the big picture (they don’t).	prchovanec	0	0	1518136344	961759651485376513	https://twitter.com/prchovanec/status/961759651485376513

	I disagree. The actors don’t have to understand the equation for the forces working on them to make the equation balance.

	Whether wider trade deficit actually results in less output (fewer jobs) or simply greater consumption and/or investment than otherwise, financed by greater external debt is unclear, depends on many factors.	prchovanec	0	0	1518134711	961752802539208705	https://twitter.com/prchovanec/status/961752802539208705

	21. Budget deficits DO matter. But they don’t always matter in ways that are readily apparent to voters.	prchovanec	14	2	1518134308	961751112985600000	https://twitter.com/prchovanec/status/961751112985600000			
	Great advice on how and where to watch the Olympics opening ceremony in the US, either live Friday morning or recorded on Friday evening: https://www. theverge.com/2018/2/8/16990 284/olympics-online-live-streaming-free-stream-pyeongchang-2018-opening-ceremony …	prchovanec	1	0	1518134202	961750667072335872	https://twitter.com/prchovanec/status/961750667072335872			
	20. The opposite is true: so long as the Fed is focused on managing the value of the dollar (pegging it to gold, for instance, like after Bretton Woods) it must let domestic interest rates do what they must to reconcile savings and investment.	prchovanec	8	1	1518133851	961749194376695808	https://twitter.com/prchovanec/status/961749194376695808			
	Because strong vs weak (expensive vs cheap) dollar involves trade-offs that most presidents don't like to think too hard about.	prchovanec	1	0	1518133291	961746845436346368	https://twitter.com/prchovanec/status/961746845436346368			
	19. In fact, even if it had tried to bring S=I into balance by keeping domestic rates high, the result might have been the same: higher US rates would have attracted capital inflows to fund the savings deficit.	prchovanec	4	2	1518133171	961746343134887936	https://twitter.com/prchovanec/status/961746343134887936			
	18. In this case, the Fed was able to lower rates DESPITE a dramatic increase in government borrowing because the rates were still high enough to attract foreign capital and the Fed was willing to let the dollar rise, and the trade deficit along with it.	prchovanec	8	3	1518133016	961745693365948416	https://twitter.com/prchovanec/status/961745693365948416			
	17. Another takeaway from the 1980s is that the Fed can strongly influence long-term interest rates via short-term rates AS LONG AS it's willing to let the dollar do what it must to balance the S=I equation via the external account.	prchovanec	12	2	1518132913	961745263760166918	https://twitter.com/prchovanec/status/961745263760166918			
	16. Whether more government borrowing is funded via higher interest rates, or via a stronger dollar and wider trade deficit, or some combination of both depends on a wide range of factors.	prchovanec	6	3	1518132572	961743833552883713	https://twitter.com/prchovanec/status/961743833552883713			
	15. My point is not that federal borrowing can be funded from abroad without consequence. There are clearly important consequences. It's that in an open economy, there isn't a straight unwavering line between greater government borrowing and higher domestic interest rates.	prchovanec	9	5	1518132465	961743383608877056	https://twitter.com/prchovanec/status/961743383608877056			
	14. It's also interesting to note where US budget deficits now stand, as a % of GDP, compared to the past. The red bars, by the way, are projections that I believe predate the recent tax cuts.	prchovanec	6	4	1518132336	961742842791161856	https://twitter.com/prchovanec/status/961742842791161856			
	13. The picture, obviously, is very complicated, with a lot of things happening simultaneously, both in the US and abroad. But the general picture is that higher government borrowing was funded from abroad, not through higher interests rates at home.	prchovanec	11	3	1518132173	961742157706072064	https://twitter.com/prchovanec/status/961742157706072064			
	12. This is very much what happened in the 1980s, when the US federal budget deficit expanded enormously. Interest rates were actually falling at the time, but the US dollar surged and the trade deficit widened greatly. pic.twitter.com/WXfp62dp45	prchovanec	15	7	1518132038	961741590040588290	https://twitter.com/prchovanec/status/961741590040588290			
	11. In any case, the need to increase national savings and/or reduce national investment via higher interest rates is reduced, and the effect is shifted onto the external balance of trade and investment, possibly induced by a stronger currency.	prchovanec	6	2	1518131716	961740240288407555	https://twitter.com/prchovanec/status/961740240288407555			
	10. It might require higher interest rates to attract these capital inflows, and it might not, depending on where domestic interest rates already stand compared to foreign ones.	prchovanec	11	4	1518131540	961739503890202632	https://twitter.com/prchovanec/status/961739503890202632			
	9. In an open economy, the dissavings from a larger budget deficit might be funded by capital inflows, implying a wider current account (trade) deficit.	prchovanec	8	6	1518131483	961739263514693633	https://twitter.com/prchovanec/status/961739263514693633			
	8. However, in an open economy, it doesn't quite work the same way, because there's the possibility of meeting investment by drawing on savings from abroad. Or even drawing on foreign savings to have negative savings, and consume more than you produce.	prchovanec	9	4	1518131351	961738709258395651	https://twitter.com/prchovanec/status/961738709258395651			
	"7. With S < I, interest rates must rise, increasing S and decreasing I until they match once again. This is commonly called the ""crowding out effect"", as higher budget deficits compete with private investment by bidding up interest rates."	prchovanec	9	6	1518131227	961738188825022464	https://twitter.com/prchovanec/status/961738188825022464			
	6. In a closed economy, investment (I) can only be funded by national savings (S), so if public savings is reduced, private savings has to be increased to compensate.	prchovanec	9	3	1518131140	961737826491609088	https://twitter.com/prchovanec/status/961737826491609088			
	5. Savings (S) in the macroeconomic equation is national savings, not just household or private savings. So when the government spends more than its tax revenues, it reduces S.	prchovanec	5	2	1518131065	961737511772057600	https://twitter.com/prchovanec/status/961737511772057600			
	4. But the point is that the federal government will be issuing more debt at the same time the Fed will be buying less of it, leaving someone else to pick up the slack.	prchovanec	19	2	1518130814	961736457697284097	https://twitter.com/prchovanec/status/961736457697284097

	Added with size to nat gas . Now a full sized. Spot. Average cost. 2.75. Already crushed natty two times this year. Huge. This is likely the 3rd time next. Target 3.25.	Bamabroker	49	7	1518188735	961979398017765376	https://twitter.com/Bamabroker/status/961979398017765376

	ONE WARNING..
