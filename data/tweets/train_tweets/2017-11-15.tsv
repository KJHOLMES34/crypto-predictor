	For some factors it does not help, but for the fungibility risk arising from higher node costs you get some offsetting benefit because you get higher fungibility from CT. Hard to quantify but that was my thought for discussion.	adam3us	4	0	1510733996	930711954276065280	https://twitter.com/adam3us/status/930711954276065280

bitcoin 	Vinny the bitcoin R & D community has more in the past been on the receiving end of a lot of ongoing negative attitudes & comments from a few Bitcoin service company CEOs, even tho their entire business depends on the work of that open community. Now you're attacking the victims.	adam3us	108	14	1510718378	930646448726614021	https://twitter.com/adam3us/status/930646448726614021			
bitcoin 	well it's not a free lunch though: ext-blocks externalise validation costs for bitcoin holders and users. I think people more prefer the drivechain approach, as then the code is not expanding consensus critical code, nor as directly increasing required data to validate main chain	adam3us	2	0	1510718035	930645008637607936	https://twitter.com/adam3us/status/930645008637607936

	This has some really fundamental implications, notably that what the crypto needs to prevent is far more complex than simply preventing double-spends. Rather, the tech has to manage liquidity risk - ~probablity that a entity will end up bankrupt.	peterktodd	30	3	1510780240	930905915653423104	https://twitter.com/peterktodd/status/930905915653423104

	"Now how do you get to the ""steal both keys and the funds are destroyed forever part""? Have the refund tx *also* use the proof-of-pub mechanism, and sign a third burn tx that happens instantly."	peterktodd	1	0	1510704503	930588253329096704	https://twitter.com/peterktodd/status/930588253329096704			
	The nuance here is the idea of a convenant is actually slightly broken at a *previous* level: if you can reliably ensure the system was setup correctly in the first place - and the funds went to the convenant enforcing address - you can setup a refund tx w/ segwit in advance.	peterktodd	4	0	1510704356	930587634853744640	https://twitter.com/peterktodd/status/930587634853744640			
	All this muck about convents and what not is just a hack to implement the much simpler scheme: prove the user was notified prior to the tx going through. A better script sys could more efficiently do this by, e.g., requiring proof that a nonce was previously revealed on-chain.	peterktodd	3	0	1510704118	930586636387098626	https://twitter.com/peterktodd/status/930586636387098626			
	This does *not* need to be on chain; offchain designs can be more efficient here, e.g. via a certificate transparency type service that's tied to the actual email notification.	peterktodd	4	0	1510703903	930585737505923072	https://twitter.com/peterktodd/status/930585737505923072			
	Also, note what EOS is doing there is more usefully though of as proof-of-publication: we want getting to state Pending Spend, to require a proof-of-publication, ensuring that the user is notified.	peterktodd	1	0	1510703819	930585385079521280	https://twitter.com/peterktodd/status/930585385079521280
