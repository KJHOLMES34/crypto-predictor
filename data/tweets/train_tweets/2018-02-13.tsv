	There is no such thing as fully trustless tech. In encryption you trust that your recipient won't forward your message. In blockchains people who don't read the code are trusting software upgrades.

	England is a Scandinavian country not a continental country. Post-Brexit we should recognise this and build an economic powerhouse around the North Sea.	dgwbirch	3	1	1518519560	963366977036279808	https://twitter.com/dgwbirch/status/963366977036279808			
	Cnut became the king of Denmark in 1018 and the King of Norway in 1028, forming the Anglo-Scandinavian North Sea Empire (which did not include Scotland). What was wrong with this arrangement? It’s been change for change’s sake ever since.	dgwbirch	1	0	1518519502	963366735477985286	https://twitter.com/dgwbirch/status/963366735477985286			
	When Ironside died, London couldn’t hold out and Cnut the Great became the King of England. He was the Son of Sweyn Forkbeard a daughter of the King of Poland (bloody Polish kings coming over here and taking all of our monarch’s jobs). He was a grandson of Harald Bluetooth.	dgwbirch	0	0	1518519433	963366442614784000	https://twitter.com/dgwbirch/status/963366442614784000			
	Just to recap... In 1016 the Saxon King Edmund Ironside died. The Saxons had already chosen Cnut as their king but London opted out and went with Ethered’s grandson Edmund Ironside. Then, as now, London was another country.	dgwbirch	4	0	1518519409	963366344677838848	https://twitter.com/dgwbirch/status/963366344677838848

	Statistics doesn't draw the link between a variable and an explanation. The data results in mathematically valid solution that can be used for pricing.

	Pricing takes historical claims (freq & severity), then uses statistical techniques to find groups within the population that cost more. It is blind to what those characteristics *actually* are - just identifies defined variables that can sort into more and less expensive.	charliehalkett	4	1	1518524814	963389015255904256	https://twitter.com/charliehalkett/status/963389015255904256

	Except as you go lower in the oversold zone you get a very reliable long range oversold signal, this says oversold, the trend breakout helps with more refined timing. Buying in the oversold zone is pretty safe as a fakeout has very limited room to go lower.	woonomic	2	1	1518511992	963335235894210560	https://twitter.com/woonomic/status/963335235894210560

	You're referring to changing the protocol to support sub-satoshi units on-chain, which is a very different issue.

bitcoin 	Technically speaking, the Bitcoin protocol does not recognize units of bitcoin - it only recognizes satoshis. Most wallet software defaults to dividing values by 100,000,000 when displaying to the user. Supporting other units is as simple as dividing by a smaller number.	lopp	478	123	1518544716	963472489635549184	https://twitter.com/lopp/status/963472489635549184

	Nixon was legitimately elected in 1972. He also broke the law, or at least helped others to do so. Therefore, while legitimately elected, he would (had he not resigned first) been legitimately removed from office.	prchovanec	0	0	1518534928	963431434554929152	https://twitter.com/prchovanec/status/963431434554929152			
	Again, I don't think that's what's at issue, any more than Watergate. If - and this is a big if - Mueller reports Trump outright colluded with Putin, he still was legitimately elected.

	Well, if you really wanted to start a bar fight in the 80s, you'd press back about the bias against females by noting there are so many Soviet art and literature and education PhDs the Pentagon could use.
