	Some East Asian & Middle Eastern cultures were harvesting & storing wild grain well before agriculture. Grains and other seeds are vulnerable to vermin. And many other kinds of food (e.g. a gel-like mash of dried fish, berries, etc.) were made and stored by some pre-ag cultures.

	"Per ""Evolutionary history of the brown rat"" the strain of that spread with trade (i.e. a vermin strain) existed uniquely in SE Asia until c. 3600 YA. Its ancestors thus lived there when pottery was invented c. 20K BCE. That they had evolved into vermin by then is my prediction."

	The spread of pottery parallels the spread of vermin rodents. Early pottery was likely a response to rats or mice gnawing through baskets to get at the food stored in early villages. http:// biorxiv.org/content/early/ 2016/12/26/096800 … http:// biorxiv.org/content/biorxi v/early/2016/12/26/096800.full.pdf … http://www. sciencemag.org/news/2017/03/w hen-did-humans-settle-down-house-mouse-may-have-answer … https://www. palmstrading.com/native-america n-pottery/native-seed-pots/ …	NickSzabo4	119	19	1515133532	949164948290076672	https://twitter.com/NickSzabo4/status/949164948290076672

bitcoin 	13) Policy makers, regulators can no longer sit idly by while Bitcoin barrels towards the biggest financial bust we’ve ever known. They need to acknowledge that we’re all going to suffer if Bitcoin ends messily. The consequences will certainly be public and perfectly distributed.	thomaspower	18	9	1515147795	949224768519200768	https://twitter.com/thomaspower/status/949224768519200768			
	12) An alternative approach would be a multilateral agreement to mine the currency at a pre-agreed cost and a pre-agreed distribution, thereby ending the proof-of-work lottery. This approach would avoid the currency stalling.	thomaspower	9	7	1515147734	949224513136406529	https://twitter.com/thomaspower/status/949224513136406529			
bitcoin 	11) What can we do? One option is for governments, or major organisations, to step in and take over running of the Bitcoin blockchain to maintain its impartiality and trustworthiness. This would avoid the risk of a winner-take-all outcome.	thomaspower	7	7	1515147684	949224303110828032	https://twitter.com/thomaspower/status/949224303110828032			
bitcoin 	10) Bitcoin is heading towards a $1 trillion valuation. If it crashes, it will destabilise the global financial system.

	9) The alternative outcome is that the proof-of-work puzzle becomes too complex to solve, blocks can’t be written and the currency stalls	thomaspower	6	7	1515147584	949223885257441280	https://twitter.com/thomaspower/status/949223885257441280			
	8) That would be ironic, given that the theoretical beauty of the technology is that it’s distributed by nature rather than concentrated in any one person or institution.	thomaspower	7	6	1515147540	949223700871696384	https://twitter.com/thomaspower/status/949223700871696384			
bitcoin 	7) As the Bitcoin blockchain becomes bigger and more complex, there are only two logical conclusions. The first is that a single miner ends up effectively owning the Bitcoin blockchain, and thereby the currency (“winner-takes-all”).	thomaspower	12	7	1515147492	949223500627304448	https://twitter.com/thomaspower/status/949223500627304448			
	6) Ordinary folks can no longer afford to be miners. Unless you’re sitting on a boundless supply of free energy to power a server farm, or you have the backing of someone with bottomless pockets, you can no longer participate.	thomaspower	9	8	1515147444	949223297627185154	https://twitter.com/thomaspower/status/949223297627185154			
	5) In order to maintain the distribution of miners – and thereby guarantee trust in the currency’s integrity – the proof-of-work is becoming increasingly laborious due to the need for ever increasingly complex puzzles to guarantee the distribution of miners.	thomaspower	7	8	1515147400	949223114566750208	https://twitter.com/thomaspower/status/949223114566750208			
bitcoin 	4) The problem lies in mining, participants in the blockchain that confirm transactions and write them into a general ledger. Miners undertake to add transactions to the Bitcoin blockchain by solving mathematical puzzles, a process known as proof-of-work, in return for payment.	thomaspower	8	6	1515147344	949222879937417217	https://twitter.com/thomaspower/status/949222879937417217

	Or...maybe...he launches FBCoin, distributes it in pre-sale to shareholders, then starts to pay users for their content with those tokens, giving them a decent share of Facebook advertising revenue.

	I genuinely don’t understand your point but it’s Friday night and I’m having my first drink of the year... I’m suggesting more referenda on the form of Brexit, or yes, overturning the original result, until there’s a 60% majority.

	Fair point and great question. How about we keep going until we find an option that can command a 60% plus majority? We clearly need a much better consensus than 52%-48% and ongoing referenda couldn’t be more drawn out or messy than the current situation, could it?	robdgill	0	0	1515187201	949390048478269441	https://twitter.com/robdgill/status/949390048478269441

	From my experience with historical datasets, young coins produce unreliable results as a few whales can manipulate prices. Mature coins (3yrs+) produce better more organic results.

	2/ To be clear - I'm not suggesting to exit your alts. This is another reason I have a separate investing and trading portfolio One is more tactical.

	I agree. I actually try to move slow. I'm never trying to be perfect with my timing, just make small allocation shifts like not moving into anymore alts yesterday and taking profits on 2.

	"The president himself has put his judgment and temperament front and center. But for Trumpers to say ""well, it's who he is and you knew it a year ago"" is a dodge.

	But inviting psychiatrists to come to DC and kibitz on the president's mental health is a stunt. It's not good politics and it's not productive. It's also walking a pretty thin line toward a violation of medical ethics. /4	RadioFreeTom	360	50	1515109366	949063585866698753	https://twitter.com/RadioFreeTom/status/949063585866698753			
	A year later, it's a legitimate point to note that it wasn't an act, it wasn't just some sort of put-on, and that instead of getting better, it's gotten a lot worse. It's who he is, and a lot of Trumpers assured us that it was *not* who he is. They were wrong. /3	RadioFreeTom	390	73	1515109311	949063354882121729	https://twitter.com/RadioFreeTom/status/949063354882121729			
	"When people argue that ""well, the voters chose him knowing what kind of guy he is,"" that leaves aside one of the important arguments from Trumpers that he wasn't *really* ""that guy,"" that it was an act, that it was just electoral hijinks, that he'd grow into the job. /2"	RadioFreeTom	213	39	1515109192	949062856988921856	https://twitter.com/RadioFreeTom/status/949062856988921856			
	So, a quick word on this whole business about psychiatrists and the President (which I commented on last year on @KCRW ). I don't think it's a good idea and Democrats should drop it. There is, however, one aspect of this that is misleading. /1	RadioFreeTom	248	62	1515109110	949062512628109312	https://twitter.com/RadioFreeTom/status/949062512628109312			@KCRW
