	Q: Wait, what? For every seller there’s a buyer? What am I missing with this naked-shorting thing? A: The seller and buyer are the same. It’s a wash-trade.

	The ‘Crash JP Morgan, Buy Silver’ campaign worked for awhile driving Silver from $17 to $50, but then $ JPM sold a fresh 10 bn Oz’s of naked shorts they created - and killed the rally.	maxkeiser	122	47	1512436692	937853578156412928	https://twitter.com/maxkeiser/status/937853578156412928			
	Putting this in context: for every $1 of sales in the Silver futures markets, naked shorts will create and sell $10 to $20 worth of contracts to keep the price from moving higher. This has been proven and documented.	maxkeiser	176	78	1512436549	937852979654352897	https://twitter.com/maxkeiser/status/937852979654352897			
bitcoin 	The issue is: # Bitcoin (the cash market for it) is approx. $200 bn. The number of naked shorts that can be created is virtually infinite. But still, given global demand/adoption for BTC, I think any BTC shorting (at these levels) will not appeal on a risk/reward basis.	maxkeiser	41	12	1512436420	937852438102577162	https://twitter.com/maxkeiser/status/937852438102577162		#

bitcoin 	Q: Can short-sellers manipulate [ # Bitcoin] futures down? A: Yes. How? Understanding Reg. SHO is a good entry point (primer) on ‘naked short selling’. So what’s gonna happen?

bitcoin 	because Bitcoin benefits from network effects, where more use cases increase value, other than direct internal priorities and relative cost, there can be an argument for going the extra mile because that is win-win, and so helps users and each company also.	adam3us	1	0	1512490191	938077972463984641	https://twitter.com/adam3us/status/938077972463984641			
bitcoin 	i think the point being made is it pushes fees higher & scale lower - for those not yet upgraded, and everyone else. not upgrading because the cost not priority for your use case is a form of negative economic externality: holds back Bitcoin generally and limits other use cases.	adam3us	1	0	1512490079	938077499631665152	https://twitter.com/adam3us/status/938077499631665152

	Sheesh. We can agree to disagree on whether the tech -in current or future iterations-will provide real value to society. What I can’t abide is the false accusation that I equated a speculative bubble with proof of tech’s success. No amount of you saying otherwise will make it so	mikejcasey	0	0	1512482719	938046629348720640	https://twitter.com/mikejcasey/status/938046629348720640			
bitcoin ethereum 	Come on. The range of Ethereum Dapps is way bigger than this. And one of the first (and biggest) bitcoin Dapps was Satoshi Dice, a gambling site. The communities are v. different, but this is not a good example of that difference.	mikejcasey	1	0	1512459770	937950377474891777	https://twitter.com/mikejcasey/status/937950377474891777

	On that quip abt my slide, suggest you refrain from judgment when not actually in the room! U snarkily implied I equated price rise as evidence of crypto’s value. My actual point: the bubble is a dangerous distraction from discussion on underlying tech.

	He has 0 proof of everything he has claimed so far. He just sucked at trading, sold everything at $1300. That's the whole story.

	Not saying there isn't anything wrong with Tethers, there might be and they should do an audit. But at the moment there is no proof.

	I'm not too familiar with Stampery, but it's worth noting that last I checked you can actually get OpenTimestamps format proofs out of it, so I'm sure it has much of the functionality of OTS.	peterktodd	0	0	1512489791	938076294486650880	https://twitter.com/peterktodd/status/938076294486650880

bitcoin 	The federation is ultimately just a multisig, where the people controlling the multisig can collectively steal funds. Here's an example of a scheme that's closer to trustless: https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2017-December/015350.html …	peterktodd	54	16	1512483929	938051707157835777	https://twitter.com/peterktodd/status/938051707157835777			
bitcoin 	Sorry! Previously that Javascript webclient didn't have the best error messages, which was fixed recently; OpenTimestamps generally takes about 1-3 hours to timestamp something to Bitcoin.	peterktodd	1	0	1512483537	938050061522690048	https://twitter.com/peterktodd/status/938050061522690048			
	FWIW, https://opentimestamps.org  has a in-browser stamper, verifier, and proof decoder; that's what I like to use when I show OTS to newbies.	peterktodd	0	0	1512474200	938010900094742528	https://twitter.com/peterktodd/status/938010900094742528			
	Failing to mandate private txs was also dishonest: it's significantly helps Zcash adoption, directly benefiting the founders who receive 20% of coins generated, while failing to provide users the privacy they expected (esp those mistakingly using wallets w/o shielded tx support).	peterktodd	51	11	1512454721	937929196688592896	https://twitter.com/peterktodd/status/937929196688592896			
	While great that @ realjeffq quantified this risk in detail, lots of people have been warning that Zcash's failure to mandate private txs, as in Monero, was obviously dangerous. Zcash seems focused on shiny new math instead of competent engineering - why the trusted setup failed.https://twitter.com/realjeffq/status/937858617860075520 …	peterktodd	108	43	1512454178	937926919735119872	https://twitter.com/peterktodd/status/937926919735119872			@
	Another possibility is they're aiming to file the defamation claim against @ Bitfinexed under UK jurisdiction, where the burden of proof is reversed: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_defamation_law …	peterktodd	14	1	1512452624	937920401996505088	https://twitter.com/peterktodd/status/937920401996505088			@

bitcoin 	An interesting possibility is that Bitfinex may have NDA's with the bank(s) involved, e.g. because they want to avoid regulatory pressure. A sketchy thing to have to do, but Tether is at high risk of govt shutdown, as happened to lots of centralized pre-bitcoin e-currencies.https://twitter.com/msantoriESQ/status/937819130476007424 …	peterktodd	85	29	1512452269	937918913245077504	https://twitter.com/peterktodd/status/937918913245077504

	I'm still watching FOX. Apparently, the FBI was supposed to warn Flynn that they had him on intercepts, and not let him do something illegal. Also - I am not making this up - it's possible Flynn didn't realize how outdated the Logan Act is, or something	RadioFreeTom	3361	913	1512432937	937837830361047040	https://twitter.com/RadioFreeTom/status/937837830361047040			
	After watching FOX for an hour, I now realize that people worried about the President’s emotional state are just crazy, and that Flynn was framed by a rogue FBI agent. I think.	RadioFreeTom	3322	600	1512432400	937835577663279104	https://twitter.com/RadioFreeTom/status/937835577663279104
