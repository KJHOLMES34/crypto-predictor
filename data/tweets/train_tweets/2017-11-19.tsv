	> but calling it a consensus failure seems incorrect given that the nodes will still always agree on the best block chain No they won't. During the periods in which the two chains have exactly equal total diff, nodes will disagree on which is head.

	"Consensus failure = when nodes disagree on what is the canonical chain. By ""cause consensus failure"" I mean a *different kind* of 51% attack, specifically one which keeps 2 chains growing forever by always mining on the currently weaker one."

	"But we already know that 51% attacks can cause consensus failure.

	PoS requires only coins for a 51% attack, so attacks can be conducted anonymously giving very little public trace of the source. This is definitely a genuine disadvantage, though there is a flipside: with PoS legitimate consensus participation is also more censorship-resistant.

bitcoin 	It’s a universal translator of value for anyone. Some people will use it to exchange rewards points for airline miles, one gift card for another, fiat for Bitcoin, etc. There’s no way to keep certain people out or limit what is exchanged. It’s just a tool.	haydentiff	4	1	1511118379	932324174953005056	https://twitter.com/haydentiff/status/932324174953005056			
bitcoin ripple 	Everybody who owned Bitcoin received BitcoinCash when the fork happened. Nobody was “gotten rid of.” Bitcoin and Ripple are both tools. Period.

	When the price goes up, the money has to come from somewhere. Ergo, there will be money flowing into exchanges (or money flowing out of altcoins). As it did here.

	A tether is a liability to the issuer, because of expectations for redemption. In layman terms: it's debt that tether inc owes to those who hold the private keys to tethers.	el33th4xor	2	0	1511112622	932300027330023425	https://twitter.com/el33th4xor/status/932300027330023425

	It's imperfect in that regard. Gold's primary appeal is that its price movements are decoupled from one's national currency, i.e. it's immune to inflation. Tether lacks that independence -- totally dependent on USD.	el33th4xor	0	0	1511111302	932294491238789120	https://twitter.com/el33th4xor/status/932294491238789120			
	You might want to read the entire thread. I'm not advocating using tether by any stretch.	el33th4xor	14	0	1511111191	932294025717088256	https://twitter.com/el33th4xor/status/932294025717088256			
	It was devoid of value judgment. Historically, tether always traded for $1.00, except for a brief few days where it went to $0.97.	el33th4xor	0	0	1511110976	932293121819455488	https://twitter.com/el33th4xor/status/932293121819455488			
bitcoin 	I made no value judgment. Just spoke to people who are facing double-digit inflation about hedging with Bitcoin.	el33th4xor	3	0	1511110854	932292610680610817	https://twitter.com/el33th4xor/status/932292610680610817			
	"But do spare us the ""what if they are fully solvent?"" posts. I would love nothing more if that were true. But we established that past good behavior is not enough to cover future risks."	el33th4xor	35	3	1511110691	932291930091917312	https://twitter.com/el33th4xor/status/932291930091917312			
	I don't know of any other way of explaining the $0 risk premium and curious to hear others' opinions.	el33th4xor	25	2	1511110643	932291726852706305	https://twitter.com/el33th4xor/status/932291726852706305			
	This is fine, but it's a precarious equilibrium. It can collapse the moment there is a change in perception.	el33th4xor	37	5	1511110519	932291208508067841	https://twitter.com/el33th4xor/status/932291208508067841			
	So people pay $1 for 1 USDT because that's what they see everyone else doing and that's what has always been done.	el33th4xor	36	4	1511110475	932291023446990853	https://twitter.com/el33th4xor/status/932291023446990853			
	An alternative explanation: (2) People are more realistic and understand that tether is imperfect. But they treat $1 USDT as being $1 USD because everyone else does so. That is, this is market psychology at work.	el33th4xor	59	9	1511110372	932290590968033280	https://twitter.com/el33th4xor/status/932290590968033280			
	If Tether Inc is indeed this kind of an operation, then they are truly unique. A cryptoasset operation with no risk. A complex operation, run by humans, dependent on so much, with zero possibility of failure. Tell us your secret sauce.	el33th4xor	63	12	1511110254	932290095494901761	https://twitter.com/el33th4xor/status/932290095494901761			
	To carry a true $0 risk premium, it has to be the case that tethers have to be operationally secure from all future failures. No CEO/CFO can abscond with keys, no bugs in underlying platform, no hacks, and of course, there is $1 USD backing every tether, and it can be redeemed.	el33th4xor	37	6	1511110167	932289729751584768	https://twitter.com/el33th4xor/status/932289729751584768			
	"We can debate, as has been suggested, whether tether is a ""fractional reserve,"" or an out and out fraudulent operation. I'm not making that point here. Let's assume that tethers are above-board perfect right now. That's not enough for a $0 premium."	el33th4xor	25	6	1511110053	932289252406251520	https://twitter.com/el33th4xor/status/932289252406251520			
	(1) The markets have decided that the company is genuinely risk-free. Not only is there no fraud in tethers right now, but they believe that the risk of fraud going forward is also 0.	el33th4xor	40	9	1511109971	932288909190533121	https://twitter.com/el33th4xor/status/932288909190533121			
	It's fascinating that the risk premium that the market demands of tether is a flat $0. I can think of only two reasons for this, but happy to hear more from others.	el33th4xor	49	14	1511109898	932288601475502088	https://twitter.com/el33th4xor/status/932288601475502088

	That's what really ticks me off about 2017. Now matter how absurd you try to be, because it's 2017, people wonder if it's true	BaldingsWorld	0	0	1511046111	932021058240110592	https://twitter.com/BaldingsWorld/status/932021058240110592			
	So rather than showing 1% benefiting at everyone else's expense, what the chart shows is a lot of people earning more.	prchovanec	4	2	1511131031	932377239848669184	https://twitter.com/prchovanec/status/932377239848669184			
	The chart gives the impression it's talking about share of income for different percentiles of the population. In fact, it shows % of people earning a certain amount, with those who advance off the chart added together into a single bar.	prchovanec	2	1	1511130923	932376787832791042	https://twitter.com/prchovanec/status/932376787832791042

	1) This chart shows absolute not relative income. So shift to the right is good. 2) It's artificially truncated on the high end. Any who advances off the chart (>$200k) is added together into a single bar. Would be interesting to see x-axis extend further.https://twitter.com/conradhackett/status/932360644548026369 …	prchovanec	11	4	1511130696	932375834148704257	https://twitter.com/prchovanec/status/932375834148704257
