	TBH, there's so much BS in that preso, it's not even worth my time. But I think you are referring to the point that miners will not bother with enforcing SegWit transactions? That's wrong because if they create a block with an invalid SegWit signature, block will be invalid.	SatoshiLite	5	1	1511846083	935376386738479104	https://twitter.com/SatoshiLite/status/935376386738479104			
bitcoin 	1) No. There's the transaction malleability bug in Bitcoin. SegWit solves this and many other issues including a scaling bump with a softfork. 2) No. It was supposed to be safely increased with consensus. We don't have consensus today to increase it obviously.	SatoshiLite	6	0	1511845044	935372026558029824	https://twitter.com/SatoshiLite/status/935372026558029824

	They would be invalid. Once SegWit has activated, you can't deactivate it without a hardfork. Nodes are now enforcing every blocks have valid segwit signatures. You can't just mine blocks without valid segwit signatures and expect them to to valid.	SatoshiLite	62	7	1511843690	935366348561006592	https://twitter.com/SatoshiLite/status/935366348561006592			
	Vinny, that risk is the same risk as miners increasing the 21M rewards or any other nefarious hardfork. That's why user nodes are important. They prevent miners from doing that. This risk is pure FUD.	SatoshiLite	53	2	1511843431	935365262127198209	https://twitter.com/SatoshiLite/status/935365262127198209
