	"By ""frequently"", prior to every time a package is downloaded would be ideal, though that may require better keyserver infrastructure.

	The way this should work is Debian should update keys frequently from keyservers *not* under Debian's control via HTTPS, to ensure that if Debian's package infrastructure is compromised apt will learn about the revocation and refuse to install the potentially backdoored packages.	peterktodd	23	2	1513875473	943888264825655297	https://twitter.com/peterktodd/status/943888264825655297			
	Fun facts: 1) Debian's apt-key doesn't use keyservers at all, which means that if a key is revoked it'll never find out. 2) By default HTTP is used, relying 100% on the PGP keys. 3) gpg and gpgv succeed when verifying revoked signatures anyway.
