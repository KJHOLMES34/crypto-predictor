	ですねぇ。任天堂は盛んに「友達同士で対戦する」ゲームジャンルをSwitchで推してますけど、「いつでもどこでもだれとでも」の推進とオンライン会員獲得の療法を狙っているんだろうな、と思っています。あの程度の値段であれば良しとする親御さんも多いでしょうしね。	mochi_wsj	1	0	1512709271	938996857501499392	https://twitter.com/mochi_wsj/status/938996857501499392			
	Some say Switch would lose momentum next year as there will be no Zelda or Splatoon. But Wii U, which had both, failed. Meanwhile, ports extend sales as more hardware spread. Right now, Switch hardware sales helping software sales is my view.	mochi_wsj	97	14	1512709075	938996036525219840	https://twitter.com/mochi_wsj/status/938996036525219840			
	あとは「今年はゼルダとスプラがあったけど来年は無いから」と言うのも不思議。ゼルダとスプラが両方あったWii Uは失敗したわけだし。で、単なる焼き直しの移植ソフトがハードが売れれば売れるほど売上を伸ばしている。Switchは「ハードがソフトの売上を引っ張っている」状況では、とは思っています。	mochi_wsj	95	79	1512708978	938995628008337408	https://twitter.com/mochi_wsj/status/938995628008337408
