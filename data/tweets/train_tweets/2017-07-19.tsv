	I don't agree with doing that. It's a lot safer to try to get overwhelming miner consensus at first, and fallback to something later second.	peterktodd	3	0	1500470413	887663367325921280	https://twitter.com/peterktodd/status/887663367325921280

	That idea completely misses the point: the problem is w/o enforcement, signaling is meaningless. Bonds also need enforcement.	peterktodd	3	1	1500469195	887658258873319425	https://twitter.com/peterktodd/status/887658258873319425			
	If you're manually signalling, Bit1+Bit4 is far safer. Equally, the purpose of signalling Bit4 is to activate segwit, thus signal both.	peterktodd	10	2	1500469117	887657933919670274	https://twitter.com/peterktodd/status/887657933919670274

	It makes no sense to signal bit4 w/o signaling bit1 - those Bitmain pools are signaling manually, and who knows what their intent is.	peterktodd	70	27	1500468638	887655920838299650	https://twitter.com/peterktodd/status/887655920838299650

	More likely than you'd think: BIP91 activation does *not* guarantee segwit, as if miners are false-signalling, segwit won't be enforced.https://twitter.com/kanzure/status/887643408612958209 …	peterktodd	85	57	1500468504	887655360043077632	https://twitter.com/peterktodd/status/887655360043077632
