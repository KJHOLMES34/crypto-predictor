	But the net effect should be the same: if you personally didn't suffer the loss your business incurred, you can't claim it.	prchovanec	1	0	1475382212	782435825766182912	https://twitter.com/prchovanec/status/782435825766182912

	So the key question is whether Trump received debt forgiveness and whether he recognized it as income.	prchovanec	8	5	1475381947	782434713298317312	https://twitter.com/prchovanec/status/782434713298317312

	presumably he was audited, however, so there may well be a satisfactory answer.	prchovanec	1	0	1475381381	782432338676293632	https://twitter.com/prchovanec/status/782432338676293632

	it's an unusually large loss to claim on an individual tax return, one that would almost certainly trigger an audit.	prchovanec	2	0	1475381247	782431776970989568	https://twitter.com/prchovanec/status/782431776970989568

	As a CPA, the question I'd immediately ask about Trump's $916 million loss is whether he was the one truly at risk for his company's loss.	prchovanec	9	12	1475380913	782430378564788224	https://twitter.com/prchovanec/status/782430378564788224
