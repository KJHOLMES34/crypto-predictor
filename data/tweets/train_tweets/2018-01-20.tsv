	indeed. but there are times when this was not the case. eg the $1200 top, and some months afterwards. there dollar cost averaging would have been better. the short and medium term future is uncertain. as a thesis the long term future is moon IMO, but short / medium? crystal ball!	adam3us	2	0	1516470451	954772393020424192	https://twitter.com/adam3us/status/954772393020424192			
bitcoin 	lightning is bitcoin: to net transactions, increase transaction capacity, make faster immediately final payments, lower fees and make new micropayment use cases possible. it is a like a write-back transaction cache above the mainchain. replacement payments shadow the writes.	adam3us	5	0	1516470343	954771937586069504	https://twitter.com/adam3us/status/954771937586069504			
bitcoin 	during which dollar cost averaging historically was better than buying all of your bitcoin allocation on day1. some kind of moderate mix, overlaid with what you think is probably reasonable. eg buy some nowish if you're starting, but have some money to buy more to lower average.	adam3us	1	0	1516470079	954770829803311105	https://twitter.com/adam3us/status/954770829803311105			
bitcoin 	going all-in on day1 may not be best as it depends on market conditions, in a general up market period all in earlier looks better. but bitcoin is both short term and mid term volatile, direction is not that predictable. dont forget bitcoin has had 18month sideways/down periods.	adam3us	0	0	1516469976	954770400751247360	https://twitter.com/adam3us/status/954770400751247360			
	another kind of buying is like dollar cost averaging, buy more on dips or oversold news to accumulate and build long-term HODLings probably a lot of people are thinking about that.	adam3us	1	0	1516469907	954770110727663621	https://twitter.com/adam3us/status/954770110727663621			
bitcoin 	i'm looking at it as risk lowered in USD terms, as a dollar allocation. historically it has been better to buy bitcoin all-in and hold. so if random buying being average 50% in bitcoin is closer to buy/hold it will win vs dip buying but be more bitcoin than dollar exposed.	adam3us	0	0	1516468817	954765538307203072	https://twitter.com/adam3us/status/954765538307203072			
	probably give you a higher return over the last year, as you have all capital working, but that's hindsight, and you have to be prepared for sideways/down/partial recovery for a year+. so for defensiveness I prefer multiple dip allocation.	adam3us	0	0	1516467923	954761788628717568	https://twitter.com/adam3us/status/954761788628717568			
	dont forget to account for capital allocation, if you have money not in use, held in reserve to fund a further dip, you are more downside protected, but less in the market for the recovery. so you'll have to pick if that is 3,4,5 or 6x say.	adam3us	0	0	1516467120	954758418337689602	https://twitter.com/adam3us/status/954758418337689602			
	yes I would expect buy in 20% dips, and repeat as it falls, and i think you said selling after making 10% to make more than random buy/sell. curious what the optimal dip % is by modelling last 12months.	adam3us	0	0	1516467065	954758189353807872	https://twitter.com/adam3us/status/954758189353807872			
	yes, but negative vs just holding. (high variance/volatile exponential function, or more accurately high growth phase of early S-curve).	adam3us	2	0	1516466945	954757687220162560	https://twitter.com/adam3us/status/954757687220162560			
	if it was a random walk, you'd expect to make zero if you bought/sold at random.	adam3us	0	0	1516466737	954756815287287809	https://twitter.com/adam3us/status/954756815287287809			
bitcoin 	"you're not necessarily trying to predict price movements, just benefit from them. bitcoin goes up, bitcoin goes down. say you modelled that as random walk. predicting price movements would be buying the oversold news (""china bans bitcoin"")."	adam3us	1	0	1516466300	954754981806055424	https://twitter.com/adam3us/status/954754981806055424			
bitcoin 	I am sure historically it's a losing strategy vs going all in bitcoin. for me it's a dollar allocation (i'm already heavily bitcoin weighted... keeping some cash, and this is a way to make bitcoin related gains and keep the profit in BTC, with a USD allocation).	adam3us	1	0	1516465869	954753173163397125	https://twitter.com/adam3us/status/954753173163397125			
	vs if you buy 20% dips, you have to calmly watch 5,10,15% dips reverse and not benefit as they recover. try not to be emotive, don't revise plan on the fly, or you run out of capital reserve for doing 5-6x dip buys. use a limit order and don't look too often!	adam3us	3	0	1516465476	954751525301116929	https://twitter.com/adam3us/status/954751525301116929			
	tradeoff is if you buy small dips you run out of funds when it falls further. i settled on using 20% as a threshold, and with amounts chosen to use capital over 5-6x times (compounded 5x=66%, 6x=74%). not sure about time period, look at last year of dips https:// twitter.com/robertreidmd/s tatus/944208162630000641 …	adam3us	23	3	1516465292	954750754136342528	https://twitter.com/adam3us/status/954750754136342528

	What makes you think markets will go back to ‘normal’ 20th century trading patterns and valuations. The new normal is there is no normal. Most smaller growth companies are private.

	Agree but maybe there is a different paradigm as nothing is like it used to be. Ie. no supply of new stock and tons of buybacks skewing the normal supply demand balance for stocks. Super low inflation from technology making ave PE higher. Many things happening here.	GerberKawasaki	0	0	1516470684	954773367659290624	https://twitter.com/GerberKawasaki/status/954773367659290624

	So I say Uber is worth $24 bil in my book. Not the $48 bil that SoftBank paid. If they were closer to break even and the brand wasn’t so damaged I’d give them the 6x. But they are troubled. #uber	GerberKawasaki	1	0	1516469933	954770216348655616	https://twitter.com/GerberKawasaki/status/954770216348655616		#uber	
	Net rev of $2 bil losing $1.5 bil per qtr. so $8 bil annual rev and $6 bil annual loss. Have to use a rev multiple as these numbers are garbage. $4bil equity. I’d buy Uber for 3x but not 6x rev that SoftBank paid.	GerberKawasaki	0	0	1516469855	954769892196012032	https://twitter.com/GerberKawasaki/status/954769892196012032			
	Also I don’t count gross books as their rev. They never receive that money. Looks like they are just losing money different than capital investment like Tesla. Uber has little assets.	GerberKawasaki	0	0	1516469676	954769142011199488	https://twitter.com/GerberKawasaki/status/954769142011199488			
	First issue. Some BS numbers to reconcile. Like on cash flow. Deferred expenses of $1bil in the qtr making it look like losing less money (cash) what is that expense? Also on rev there is a cost of rev. Not sure what that is $1 bil #uber	GerberKawasaki	0	0	1516469607	954768852730241026	https://twitter.com/GerberKawasaki/status/954768852730241026		#uber
