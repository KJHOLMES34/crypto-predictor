	IMO the #1 user experience need for crypto continues to be secure key management solutions. Multisig, scorched earth vaults, uPort-style social account recovery, hardware wallets, all good, but lots of work UI side (and formally verifying the actual contracts!) left to be done	VitalikButerin	2586	707	1513059688	940466614960398336	https://twitter.com/VitalikButerin/status/940466614960398336		#1

	Right now my favorite token model is OMG-style staking tokens. Reasons: * Not a medium-of-exchange token * Clear valuation model (expected discounted future tx fees minus node operation cost) * Requires running node to get returns, not passive income (so more legally defensible)	VitalikButerin	4208	8220	1513050908	940429788673536000	https://twitter.com/VitalikButerin/status/940429788673536000

	"Except the chains will share consensus security, and will communicate asynchronously.

ripple 	If you were going to issue an ICO on Ripple, you get set the IOUs to make them follow the rules of the JOBS Act, for example.

	You can check out a list of resources we put together here: http://dev.lightning.community/resources  And if you have questions, just ask. We're a friendly community. And it's a much better look to show a genuine desire to learn than to come in with false statements and accusations.	starkness	39	3	1513103947	940652251454025728	https://twitter.com/starkness/status/940652251454025728			
	The concept was actually *first proposed* in 2015. Turns out building new financial cryptographic protocols takes time, developer effort, research, etc. Like I said, this stuff is not easy.	starkness	32	1	1513103802	940651641354817537	https://twitter.com/starkness/status/940651641354817537

	7. But instead of doing actual research about the progress LN devs have made, it's a lot easier to not bother and complain instead. Haters gonna hate. Builders gonna build. I'd much rather be building real technology that solves real problems. /fin	starkness	95	18	1513101986	940644024368611328	https://twitter.com/starkness/status/940644024368611328			
	6. Routing is all automated and built in. The software just calculates the route and send the payment. If anyone along the path can't forward, the payment rolls back and a different route is tried. All within seconds or less.	starkness	34	6	1513101704	940642839981015040	https://twitter.com/starkness/status/940642839981015040

	5. Anti-LN proponents keep asserting that the network will evolve to some theoretical super centralized model, even though our current graph is scale-free (aka distributed), much like how the internet is a scale-free nework. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scale-free_network …	starkness	35	5	1513101060	940640141034405888	https://twitter.com/starkness/status/940640141034405888			
	"4b. Nope. We'll use something like existing internet routing protocols where the nodes know some of the higher-level routes, and more details about ""neighborhoods."" None of these paths decrease privacy from the already onion-routed, private point we're at now."	starkness	13	1	1513100934	940639610811555840	https://twitter.com/starkness/status/940639610811555840			
	4a. We use onion routing privacy technology. Having a map of the network doesn’t allow you to track who is paying whom. An intermediate node doesn't know which hop it is on the network, and doesn't know about other nodes aside from the ones directly before or after.	starkness	35	7	1513100750	940638842322804736	https://twitter.com/starkness/status/940638842322804736			
	3. If the other side drops off, you have a timeout period that is a configurable parameter. We typically say it should be set for several days for security reasons in case a counterparty tries to cheat. It can be shorter or longer though.	starkness	29	4	1513100327	940637066886397953	https://twitter.com/starkness/status/940637066886397953			
	2. To use a payment channel, you have to commit the funds you plan to use for that channel/use case (or none if receiving). You can always open another one, and we expect people to have several.	starkness	27	4	1513100181	940636456011276288	https://twitter.com/starkness/status/940636456011276288

	I finally figured out what I can't stand about millennials. They've got so little hope for their lives (based on economic factors) that they've basically retreated into fantasy worlds. Now I understand, I think I can do better at dealing with them.

	Question is *brands* or *fans* at the root. If it's going to be good and stay good it's going to need more money than fans can front, so my suspicion is it'll be advanced product placement. Or they'll just merge the whole thing into the porn industry. That's the other route.	leashless	2	2	1513092172	940602861544787968	https://twitter.com/leashless/status/940602861544787968

	In a nutshell, I’m saying (1) crypto sized gains have been the norm in a similar industry unnoticed by the public. And (2) some ICO valuations are not so crazy when you add the impact of liquidity into their valuation. /3	woonomic	175	30	1513110974	940681722278051841	https://twitter.com/woonomic/status/940681722278051841

	Typically VCs invest in emerging tech expecting 1000x over 5yrs. To the public markets that would be called a bubble.

	what I fear here.. is TLT at 123 weds.. sets up a rally back to 130... and then in JAN.. a move from 130 would start into 105 next summer... I am afraid we could have one more 4 and 5 left EW term wise.. being fluid here in that area over next few days..

	what I wanted to see.. was TLT drift up into 127s into FED.. and GOLD 1257 area... and I would feel great about positioning... but if gold goes down more... and TLT heads to 123s...

	if we see a 2 buck spike down into weds in TLT... and GOLD.. down another 5-10 bucks into WEDS... TLT at 123s???
