	Don, look at Europe. We're facing civil war either way. And there's no faster way to stop the Trump movement than granting amnesty to illegals. Promising to deport the illegals is why he won.

ripple 	XRP has always been the least interesting part about Ripple for me. I like Ripple Consensus, it makes more sense to me than PoW or PoS. I love what the network can do -it’s the perfect platform for a LETSystem.

ripple 	AFAIK, you’re correct that the majority of Ripple’s customers are banks. Rippleco sells proprietary software. But I don’t know if any banks own XRP (yet). I think they’ll want it eventually, but in the beginning banks wouldn’t go near it. That’s why Ripple had to pivot.	haydentiff	4	0	1514675123	947242238911893504	https://twitter.com/haydentiff/status/947242238911893504

	No, the EU won’t compromise on their core principles. Doesn’t stop the UK doing so though, by which I mean leaving the EU but accepting free movement, courts, regulation etc to stay in the CU & SM.

	"I have very significant concerns about our fundamental cryptography, and a generation of programmers who think that ""encrypted"" is the same as secret.

	Yes, that's a tricky one. Maidsafe's another. But they're all going to depend on symmetric ciphers to keep the data on them secret, and if we get a fail in any major cipher, symmetric or otherwise, the shit hits the fan in the worse possible way.

	30/ Understand the technology, so you have the confidence to invest in the long term prospects, even if the short term may look bleak. Life comes at you fast, so make sure you’re ready for it. Whatever happens, stay humble, stay classy. Happy new year! <3 /end	onemanatatime	408	34	1514729993	947472379843710976	https://twitter.com/onemanatatime/status/947472379843710976			
	29/ If you’re here, you might have seen what I first saw in BTC back in 2013, and as an early adopter, you’re already ahead of 98% others. Make full use of this opportunity because I’m not exaggerating when I say this only comes once-in-a-lifetime.	onemanatatime	277	25	1514729956	947472224750944256	https://twitter.com/onemanatatime/status/947472224750944256

	27/ The seasons affect (crypto) trading. Q4/Q1 is when Altcoin markets pick up again. Sell in May and go away has been appropriate for the alt coin market for the last 3 years. Doesn’t mean it will continue to be true in the future.	onemanatatime	197	19	1514729932	947472123903148032	https://twitter.com/onemanatatime/status/947472123903148032			
	26/ Another thing that might help; instead of looking for price targets, look for ‘time’ target. I personally find it easier to measure markets according to time rather than by price, which perhaps could be driven by events with known dates.	onemanatatime	116	9	1514729922	947472084468252672	https://twitter.com/onemanatatime/status/947472084468252672			
	25/ If charting is completely new to you, start with ‘triple screen trading system’, a top-down method of analysing the markets. Start with the highest timeframes (1W 1D) to get a sense of the big picture, before zooming into smaller timeframes. Execute on the smallest timeframe.	onemanatatime	201	19	1514729902	947471998325624833	https://twitter.com/onemanatatime/status/947471998325624833			
	24/ But doing all that alone won’t make you a better trader. Nothing can replace screen time and actually making trades and mistakes and learning from them. So get skin in the game, and go out there and start experimenting with various strategies and test your hypotheses.	onemanatatime	107	10	1514729878	947471900250226688	https://twitter.com/onemanatatime/status/947471900250226688			
	23/ There’s no magic to getting better at trading. Understanding basics of FA & TA is essential, and can be easily from reading articles, books, watching videos. You're lucky to have a ton of available resources today to accelerate your learning and shorten the learning curve.	onemanatatime	123	11	1514729846	947471765093023744	https://twitter.com/onemanatatime/status/947471765093023744			
	22/ Trading is not easy. But neither is it rocket science. More than a game of numbers, it is a game of people, of emotions, and human psychology. It’s about systematically taking high probability trades for a positive return over the long run.	onemanatatime	203	34	1514729814	947471628753035264	https://twitter.com/onemanatatime/status/947471628753035264			
	21/ The point of looking at charts, is to decide where the best market opportunities are, and what price and time to enter. If crypto trading is new to you, let me just leave you with some of my overarching thoughts about how to approach trading markets.	onemanatatime	99	9	1514729802	947471581516767233	https://twitter.com/onemanatatime/status/947471581516767233			
	20/ potential to quickly increase your BTC multiple folds. Needless to say, this comes with immense risk, and since trading is not easy, goes back to why >90% of traders lose money, or rather, underperformed compared to the market index.	onemanatatime	101	7	1514729771	947471450146873346	https://twitter.com/onemanatatime/status/947471450146873346			
	19/ From my observation, 90% of traders are underperforming a simple BTC only BUY & HODL strategy. If you underperformed the index being $ BTCUSD, you LOST money! But no doubt, trading alt coins or margin, whichever floats your boat, is a highly enticing endeavour with the	onemanatatime	107	10	1514729755	947471381997936642	https://twitter.com/onemanatatime/status/947471381997936642			
bitcoin 	18/ I’m just an average human who found out about Bitcoin couple years earlier than most, stuck to my beliefs, and spent a lot of time observing and learning how to play the game. Even with making a ton of mistakes, I managed to outperform the market, and I’m sure you can too.	onemanatatime	140	8	1514729744	947471335126532097	https://twitter.com/onemanatatime/status/947471335126532097			
	17/ Other common mistakes include not (knowing when to) sitting in cash, or BTC, or take positions. Using entire portfolio, being overexposed, taking too much risk, being greedy. Need to learn to be patient, sit on my hands - know when to HODL, when to take profit and move on.	onemanatatime	136	13	1514729734	947471296874528769	https://twitter.com/onemanatatime/status/947471296874528769			
	16/ If a trade is easy to take, it is usually wrong. FOMO buy breakouts less, especially if it is only the first or second attempts which usually fail. If a trade is taking longer than expected to move, get out!	onemanatatime	123	12	1514729695	947471131820175361	https://twitter.com/onemanatatime/status/947471131820175361			
	15/ It's paramount to form your own opinion on the market, and not depend on tips from others. It’s the only way to remain consistent. To that end, I make sure to clean up my Twitter feed every once in a while. Instead of getting euphoric with Twitter, I use it as an exit signal.	onemanatatime	139	17	1514729685	947471090007162880	https://twitter.com/onemanatatime/status/947471090007162880			
	14/ Confirmation bias is another problem, looking for news/tips that agree with my view, adding false confidence. Need to be self-aware, more objective, remove biases. Don’t marry your positions/bags! How will new information affect the market? What will participants think?	onemanatatime	148	18	1514729632	947470867537174529	https://twitter.com/onemanatatime/status/947470867537174529			
	13/ Holding on for too long is another painful lesson. Greedy expectations of unrealistic gains. Trading on “hope” will most times end in disaster. Refusing to take losses when market has proven you wrong - can be very painful.	onemanatatime	156	19	1514729609	947470769444945923	https://twitter.com/onemanatatime/status/947470769444945923			
	12/ This largely boils down to not having a system in place! The easiest part about trading is coming up with a plan. The hard part is having discipline to actually follow it.	onemanatatime	153	12	1514729593	947470705011998720	https://twitter.com/onemanatatime/status/947470705011998720			
	11/ *Never* go all in. If you did on one coin, bought the dip too early, or averaged down in a downtrend, it is likely you end up with no funds left to take on new trade setups. The opportunity cost of doing so is HUGE! Some traders stick to 1/2% risk per trade for good reason!	onemanatatime	154	12	1514729577	947470638209425409	https://twitter.com/onemanatatime/status/947470638209425409			
	10/ I’m trying to improve all the time. I may not be the most analytical person, but I play to my strengths, such as listening to my instincts (having trained them for years). I learnt so much from crypto trading this year, and maybe some of these lessons might be useful for you.	onemanatatime	140	8	1514729514	947470373213241344	https://twitter.com/onemanatatime/status/947470373213241344			
	9/ I’m a horrible trader and I make mistakes ALL the time. I hold on to losers too long, add to losers, buy full size in one-go, buy too large a size, risk too much, fall prey to my emotions, and sold when I should have held. But we all do this in some way. Losses are inevitable!	onemanatatime	215	21	1514729495	947470293294915586	https://twitter.com/onemanatatime/status/947470293294915586			
	8/ Sometimes we make bad trades, get phished/hacked. Whatever happens, get back up, learn from it, move on! Losses are part of trading and the faster you get over that, the quicker you become a winner. If we took all our trades perfectly, we’d all easily be zillionaires by now.	onemanatatime	174	18	1514729484	947470244557111297	https://twitter.com/onemanatatime/status/947470244557111297			
bitcoin 	7/ Anyway, my security is horrible. I lost 95% of my coins in 2014 getting hacked coz I didn’t have 2FA on my exchange. Got scammed on bitcointalk a couple times. Got phished once or twice. And I always have to make the same mistake twice or thrice before I really learn.	onemanatatime	169	13	1514729470	947470187875352576	https://twitter.com/onemanatatime/status/947470187875352576			
	6a/ @ brucefenton made a very well articulated video about this so I won’t delve into it. Highly recommended watch:https://twitter.com/brucefenton/status/938886923392831489 …	onemanatatime	159	13	1514729450	947470104819679237	https://twitter.com/onemanatatime/status/947470104819679237			@
bitcoin 	6/ Common fallacy is that anyone who heard about or got into bitcoin early is rich today. Anyone who got in before 2015 might have sold much earlier. Anyone who got in after 2015 might have sold 10x ago, or had his coins hacked along the way and have had to restart.	onemanatatime	165	16	1514729416	947469961076686850	https://twitter.com/onemanatatime/status/947469961076686850			
	5/ That however took 4 years to materialize. Not only that, but it started with almost 2 years of downtrend, during which BTC lost nearly 90% of its value. Imagine trying to hold on to your beliefs while price declines so dramatically. Not easy.	onemanatatime	197	19	1514729401	947469898451623938	https://twitter.com/onemanatatime/status/947469898451623938			
	4/ As a newcomer, its easy to get exuberant about the technology, thinking it will change the world tomorrow and that adoption will happen overnight. Entering BTC at $200 and seeing it rise to $1000 in 2013, I thought it was going to get to $10,000 in no time at all.	onemanatatime	145	23	1514729374	947469783586316288	https://twitter.com/onemanatatime/status/947469783586316288			
bitcoin 	3/ By most measures, Bitcoin adoption is still in the early adopter phase and there’s a huge once-in-a-lifetime opportunity sitting right under our noses if we care to look. As I said before, play your cards right and you’ll be able to achieve financial freedom in <5 years.	onemanatatime	214	31	1514729357	947469712866254848	https://twitter.com/onemanatatime/status/947469712866254848			
	2/ Thankful I stuck to it, even when nobody around me saw it the same way I did. It was the possibility of financial freedom that first attracted me, but like many others, its not the only reason I stayed. Since August 2013 I’ve practically been following the BTC price every day.	onemanatatime	132	12	1514729341	947469644486524928	https://twitter.com/onemanatatime/status/947469644486524928			
bitcoin 	1/ As a follower of tech/startup news, I came across a Bitcoin article in April 2013, but dismissed it as a bubble/fad. Read into it 6 months later, got hooked forever once I understood it was more significant than the internet and was the most revolutionary invention in my life.	onemanatatime	168	16	1514729316	947469541105221633	https://twitter.com/onemanatatime/status/947469541105221633

bitcoin ripple 	The Ripple validators don't actually just validate, they decide what the consensus actually is.

ripple 	If I were Ripple, I'd just say that Ripple is a centralized payment network that can be audited by third parties for transaction validity.
