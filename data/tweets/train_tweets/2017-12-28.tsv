	Well hello, @ Forbes! Yes, $ XRP has risen > 20,000% YTD. Welcome to # xrpthestandard.https://twitter.com/forbes/status/946146855192276992 …	haydentiff	251	77	1514424880	946192646455812096	https://twitter.com/haydentiff/status/946192646455812096		#	@
	The way people are photoshopping fake images, it wouldn’t surprise me if that was their motive for spreading FUD. But $ XRP is gaining ground for significant reasons that have nothing to do with the peanut gallery on Twitter.	haydentiff	3	0	1514424012	946189004092858369	https://twitter.com/haydentiff/status/946189004092858369			
	I hope it will be. We’ll know that $ XRP has been added when we visit Coinbase and see it there. It’s damaging, not helpful, to post speculation.	haydentiff	4	0	1514421328	946177748229275648	https://twitter.com/haydentiff/status/946177748229275648			
bitcoin 	If you have # Bitcoin, another option is to convert it into $ XRP via @ ShapeShift_io or @ Changelly_team. The exchange rates will most likely be higher though, fyi.

	I’m sure $ XRP will be added to Coinbase at some point. XRP is the first crypto with a company behind it, something that, unfortunately, could easily be taken advantage of. (extortion)	haydentiff	4	0	1514420436	946174003525271552	https://twitter.com/haydentiff/status/946174003525271552

	You are confused and have not thought about these issues. Start with the law: are you sure you understand what copyright is?

	There is no community. There are workers, people writing code or building other infrastructure, and there are users, just like in every open source software project.

	There's also a much more subtle, harder to action insight about short run engineering.

	No, DCR staking is a trustless setup done at the protocol level. DCR while staked is safer than being in your hot wallet as nobody can take those funds, not even yourself, until the coins are unlocked and returned to your wallet via the protocol.	woonomic	8	2	1514483682	946439277876985856	https://twitter.com/woonomic/status/946439277876985856			
	I said the graphs are pretty, as for UI we took great lengths to simplify the interaction. Ultimately, one click staking within a wallet is the holy grail, maybe we can get this solved working with wallet providers.	woonomic	6	0	1514483432	946438230030688256	https://twitter.com/woonomic/status/946438230030688256			
	Given locking up is just a multisig tx, I'd treat my LN balance as an alternative to using a hot wallet, but with near zero fees with instant settlement.
