bitcoin 	They could easily demand if for speculative reasons.

	5/ In bull markets, its easy to fall into the “rising prices confer value” trap. But eventually, prices and value converge, and those on the wrong side of that trap are the ones left holding the bag.

	4/ So when valuing something, cryptocurrency or otherwise, it’s worth repeatedly asking yourself “am I buying this because it’s underpriced, or because I’ve irrationally begun to think it’s valuable because the price is rising?”	AriannaSimpson	31	7	1514560700	946762313859821568	https://twitter.com/AriannaSimpson/status/946762313859821568			
	3/ This is counter to logic. If you’ve ascertained the value of something, you should be MORE willing to buy it at a lower price — it significantly increases the likelihood you eventually make a profit from its sale.

	It's really dubious of Zooko to flat out say that he doesn't think Monero's privacy is good enough, without mentioning the trusted setup of Zcash (or for that matter, the major performance limitations of zk-SNARKs).	peterktodd	196	39	1514564964	946780200410533888	https://twitter.com/peterktodd/status/946780200410533888			
	"Someone finally asked a Q: about the trusted setup, which Zooko never mentioned in relation to Zcash.

	In response to a Q: on proof-of-stake, claims there's a lot of smaller coins that use it and haven't been attacked.

	For the record, that I was involved in the trusted setup has nothing to do with my criticism of Zcash/Zooko one way or another.

	"...and now Zooko is claiming that Zcash is ""encryption"", comparing it to AES, and to break Zcash you'd need to break the same crypto that underlies the web. You know what else could break Zcash?
