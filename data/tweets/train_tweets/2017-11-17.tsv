	Bcash (UAHF) was a response to UASF, which threatened the miners. So miners hardforked to create another SHA256d coin that they can keep control of.

bitcoin 	"It's ironic, really. I was originally labeled a Bitcoin maximalist in 2014, by Vitalik and others.

bitcoin 	To be clear, I don't think that Bitcoin will ever be the sole cryptocurrency in the world, but rather that it will continue to dominate in market cap and serve as the basis for the internet of money. # schellingpoint # networkeffects # modularscaling # leanblockchain # immutability	TuurDemeester	241	47	1510927864	931525094991679494	https://twitter.com/TuurDemeester/status/931525094991679494		# # # # #

	besides I expect Roger & Jihan were trading the heck out of their insider knowledge. someone did the BCH pump. how do we know other NYA people eg did not sell B2X futures before cancelling.

	If you're a competent dev who is philosophically OK with centralized systems, why would you work on 2x/BCH when you could make 2x to 3x the money working for a bank? Heck, the bank will be more interesting work too: smart contracts rather than dumb transactions.	peterktodd	103	18	1510936453	931561120615288833	https://twitter.com/peterktodd/status/931561120615288833			
	You might ask: Aren't there competent people who are ok with more centralization? There sure are! You meet them at fintech conferences, because centralized banks need lots of reasonably competent people, and they pay much better than BTC development does.	peterktodd	111	19	1510935865	931558653940895744	https://twitter.com/peterktodd/status/931558653940895744			
	Remember that competence is task specific: while 2X/BCH has incompetent devs, it has fairly competent politicians, driven by bad incentives. That's why 2x/BCH have gotten as far as they have.	peterktodd	170	41	1510935377	931556608236294144	https://twitter.com/peterktodd/status/931556608236294144			
bitcoin 	It wasn't all that hard to get consensus to do a safe blocksize increase via segwit among the competent side of the 2X debate. That's because the real disagreement is about centralization. For instance, whether a tiny group meeting in a NY hotel should control Bitcoin's future.	peterktodd	158	28	1510935041	931555197997977602	https://twitter.com/peterktodd/status/931555197997977602			
bitcoin 	With Core-vs-2X, the story isn't two differing opinions on the right way to scale Bitcoin; the real story is one side trying to build a decentralized currency, and another side w/ various motivations to make Bitcoin more centralized (who happened to have some incompetent devs).	peterktodd	239	51	1510934643	931553527436120064	https://twitter.com/peterktodd/status/931553527436120064			
	Problem is, ignorant people - an axis *distinct* from competence - often can't tell the difference. Journalists exacerbate this problem by presenting issues as having two sides with equally valid opinions. The real story is usually why the incompetent side is being pushed at all.	peterktodd	243	49	1510934340	931552259292442626	https://twitter.com/peterktodd/status/931552259292442626			
bitcoin 	Within the competent side of Bitcoin, there's actually a lot of disagreement; I personally think much of the long-term direction and focus of Bitcoin Core is misguided. But those disagreements are minor compared to how batshit crazy the 2X/BCH/Craig Wright side is.	peterktodd	253	52	1510934046	931551026812997633	https://twitter.com/peterktodd/status/931551026812997633			
	Worth noting: often things polarize into competent and incompetent groups because 1) dealing with incompetent people sucks a lot more than dealing with people you disagree with, and 2) there's usually at least some common ground that you can make progress on.	peterktodd	172	35	1510933769	931549861920628736	https://twitter.com/peterktodd/status/931549861920628736

bitcoin 	that is correct as well, which is why if Satoshi decided to dump his coins, he can crash the MCap of # Bitcoin by 90% cause he is holding 5%. If 90% of # Bitcoin MCap was actively traded him dumping 5% will not make that much of a problem.

bitcoin 	not it can move it like 90%, cause maybe 10% of that market is tradable the rest is in cold storage by people or is lost. you have to compare tether liquidity to amount of bitcoin circulating on exchanges not total MCap.

	I was in Russia in the early 90s talking to actual Russians about this. Take my word for it that NATO expansion pissed off a lot of people because of how it was done.	RadioFreeTom	2	0	1510890920	931370143451635712	https://twitter.com/RadioFreeTom/status/931370143451635712

	Always remember that the thing Putin fears the most, maybe even more than nuclear war, is being deposed by his own people. He will attack every form of democratic government to forestall that possibility. Including, first and foremost, ours. /11x	RadioFreeTom	511	154	1510890765	931369492550180864	https://twitter.com/RadioFreeTom/status/931369492550180864			
	So, the Russians have attempted to smear all of the democracies, as a way of showing that Russia's mafia is no worse than any other. /10	RadioFreeTom	230	57	1510890712	931369269853675520	https://twitter.com/RadioFreeTom/status/931369269853675520			
	Putin, in order to keep his regime afloat and legit in the eyes of his people and the world, has to prove that the democracies are no better than Russia and not a model to emulate. /9	RadioFreeTom	229	82	1510890658	931369043738742785	https://twitter.com/RadioFreeTom/status/931369043738742785			
	It is, perhaps more than anything, the fact that we stopped being so concerned about Russia that offended Putin and his coterie so much. But there is more to this than bruised ego. /8	RadioFreeTom	155	33	1510890618	931368873139625984	https://twitter.com/RadioFreeTom/status/931368873139625984			
	We also screwed up: Bill Clinton, especially, by pressing rapid NATO expansion, played into the hands of Russian nationalists. But still, NATO cannot invade Russia. And doesn't care to. /7	RadioFreeTom	162	34	1510890388	931367910781734912	https://twitter.com/RadioFreeTom/status/931367910781734912			
	This takes us by surprise in the West, because when the Soviet Union collapsed, we stopped caring. We cut our military and slashed our nuclear inventory. /6	RadioFreeTom	161	28	1510890348	931367741692497925	https://twitter.com/RadioFreeTom/status/931367741692497925			
	To this end, Putin and his Soviet Men in the power ministries *must* identify the West as the enemy, especially now that the Russian people have developed a taste for, and access to, things Western. /5	RadioFreeTom	175	43	1510890270	931367416877191168	https://twitter.com/RadioFreeTom/status/931367416877191168			
	Putin's regime is predicated on the sore nerve of Russia's sense of victimhood and insecurity - which is also a way Russia absolves itself of its Soviet-era crimes against its neighbors. /4	RadioFreeTom	196	48	1510890201	931367127696728064	https://twitter.com/RadioFreeTom/status/931367127696728064			
	Whether he was always a just a KGB stooge, or made a run at being a more democratic leader and failed is irrelevant. This is now a Soviet mafia state. /3	RadioFreeTom	203	46	1510890145	931366893310668800	https://twitter.com/RadioFreeTom/status/931366893310668800			
	There was a time when post-Communist Russia and the West were, if not friends, at least not enemies. Putin, a man of the Soviet system, seemed to be part of that for a time. /2	RadioFreeTom	133	30	1510890080	931366618206277632	https://twitter.com/RadioFreeTom/status/931366618206277632
