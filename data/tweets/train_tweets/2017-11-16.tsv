ethereum 	http://github.com/ethereum/sharding … Picking up rapidly over the last month or two.	VitalikButerin	18	7	1510837234	931144968017649665	https://twitter.com/VitalikButerin/status/931144968017649665			
ethereum 	Base chain scaling and L2 issues and tradeoffs are core to ethereum's scalability challenges, so the abstract discussion is very relevant to us.	VitalikButerin	64	4	1510837194	931144797682745350	https://twitter.com/VitalikButerin/status/931144797682745350			
ethereum 	Not if there's a mass exit attack! Attacker maliciously exits 10m channels at once, can only challenge 5m of them within 28 days. The systemic risks around these scenarios worry me. This is part of why despite the various L2s on ethereum I still take sharding very seriously.

	The primary use case for math is to make it easier to make and evaluate the truth of generalizeable claims about the world, ie. it's a thinking aid. Language is primarily about communicating. That said, many examples of each one being used for the other's primary purpose exist.

	That said, humanity living that kind of lifestyle has costs. Another equilibrium is that dense cities become highly surveilled police states like airports are today, and this effectively prevents bioweapon attacks.

	We then replace heavy industry with mostly self-sustaining and self-regenerating decentralized approaches, with some combo of AI, genetic engineering and market mechanisms.

	I view it as part of our job to pre-empt some of that at least in the cyber-sphere by building decentralized tools that go a good enough job of solving some of the problems without creating massive global-scale political power levers.

	Do you have any proof at all that my money was on the line, or that my friends' money was on the line and I knew about it? My DAO holdings at the time totalled.... $19,500.

bitcoin 	I do regret writing the tweet in that way.

	That said, I agree there were characters who pushed miners to deliberately attack BTC. I deplore that, and I believe I have credibility to say that given my past statements:https://twitter.com/vitalikbuterin/status/898914436995575808 …	VitalikButerin	4	4	1510802699	931000115178827776	https://twitter.com/VitalikButerin/status/931000115178827776			
	BCH going up when 2x shut down was something I fully expected to happen. It's like if democratic party collapses, obviously Greens would grow massively. And rapid BCH price grows of course exacerbates difficulty-related spikes that have already been happening for months	VitalikButerin	6	4	1510802478	930999188225122304	https://twitter.com/VitalikButerin/status/930999188225122304			
bitcoin 	The latter implies that *their original plan* was in fact bitcoin cash having a consistent 10 min block time with their new fancy diff algo while 1x and 2x would be fighting, presenting themselves as a beacon of stability. This is a legitimate competitive strategy.	VitalikButerin	7	3	1510802280	930998356796620800	https://twitter.com/VitalikButerin/status/930998356796620800			
	1. The situation that happened could well have happened anyway without EDA. 2. They planned changing diff algo away from EDA way before November, and before 2x cancellation was known.	VitalikButerin	2	2	1510802208	930998057713336320	https://twitter.com/VitalikButerin/status/930998057713336320

	I disagree that there was an attack. I notice that a lot of your complaints about me flow from that premise. And I agree that if the premise was true, what I said would have been unjustified.

	The cash flow doesn't benefit you until you sell for a higher price to someone else. Reason for investment and speculation is different. But the end result is the same: you expect (or hope) that you can sell it at a higher price. Of course, this ignores dividend.

	One thing is for sure. The promised returns cannot be sustained and that’s enough for me to put them in the scam bucket unless they show otherwise.	SimonDixonTwitt	1	0	1510794080	930963967253536768	https://twitter.com/SimonDixonTwitt/status/930963967253536768			
	I assure you that no miner is as dumb as what you describe. BCH was simply an emergency response to a corporate takeover of BTC.	el33th4xor	2	0	1510860073	931240761605214209	https://twitter.com/el33th4xor/status/931240761605214209

	Makes no sense Eric. Hashpower does not control the network. It's cognitive dissonance to claim that Jihan is attacking BTC, while Adam is linking to my blog posts about how hashpower confers no control.	el33th4xor	7	1	1510852520	931209081997725698	https://twitter.com/el33th4xor/status/931209081997725698			
	I haven't looked into the new DAA carefully, but in general, hunting around a stable value is perfectly fine, a classical explore-exploit tradeoff. For comparison, TCP isn't stable, either, but hunts around a window size.	el33th4xor	0	0	1510810094	931031131914465280	https://twitter.com/el33th4xor/status/931031131914465280			
	Well, what I described to Bitfinex'ed was a hawala scheme. More fresh money comes in, pays off the earlier people who are departing, ad infinitum, assuming price is going up. If fresh money stops, game ends.	el33th4xor	2	0	1510804632	931008222466596864	https://twitter.com/el33th4xor/status/931008222466596864			
	A coherent theory of what could be happening at Bitfinex: a hawala system of sorts, where new entrants play older players who are departing.

	「WSJによると」と書いていただくのはありがたいのですが、誤引用が目立つんですよね。「来年度には2500万から3000万→現在の2500万から来年度には3500万」「3億3000万本→3億3000本」「一年以上→一年近く」などなど。何が言いたいかというとですね、元記事もどうぞ読んでくださいということです。	mochi_wsj	17	23	1510804134	931006132977467392	https://twitter.com/mochi_wsj/status/931006132977467392

	まあ、たしかにこの段階で任天堂をショート推しの会社はかなり少数派ですね。こと任天堂に関しては株価が上がりすぎてしまってどこまで材料織り込んでいるのか見えないなぁ、というのが個人的な感想です。	mochi_wsj	2	0	1510802763	931000382800535552	https://twitter.com/mochi_wsj/status/931000382800535552			
	ちなみにアナリスト（18社）の目標株価中央値は任天堂で52,300円、ソニーは5,500円。大手さんだと任天堂とPS含むソニーは別々の担当です。任天堂はゲームセクターで、ソニーは民生電機に入るから。故に、FGOあたりに関しては皆さん多少苦労された節が見られます…。	mochi_wsj	11	11	1510802627	930999814837252096	https://twitter.com/mochi_wsj/status/930999814837252096			
	BGCは任天堂をショートで継続。さしあたっての好材料は全て現在の株価に織り込み済みでピーク、というのは従来からの主張。現在のバリュエーションは高すぎ、ソニーは任天堂の半分のマルチプルにあることを指摘。	mochi_wsj	4	5	1510801940	930996932704591872	https://twitter.com/mochi_wsj/status/930996932704591872

	Echoの招待がなく買えないのでα6500を買うことにする。そうすると6Kと合わせ2台持ちになるんだけど、今持っているのは12/35/50。これに24を足そうか迷う。足したとして12/24で運用するか24/35or50か。うーん。迷う。とりあえず24をソニストで見せてもらうかな。	mochi_wsj	3	1	1510798471	930982381439168513	https://twitter.com/mochi_wsj/status/930982381439168513			
	そういえば、ソニーCFOの吉田さんもPS事業について聞かれ、これからはハードウェアの普及台数よりもアクティブユーザー数を見ていきたい、と発言されていましたっけ。理由はグループ全体が掲げる「リカーリング型ビジネス」強化のため。	mochi_wsj	11	4	1510788452	930940361077243904	https://twitter.com/mochi_wsj/status/930940361077243904			
	野村證券。ソニーをBuyで継続。目標株価は6,300円。FGOなどのアニメ関連IPの価値を最大化していく取り組みを評価。一方PS事業はPlusやゲーム内課金などハードウェアからプラットフォームに利益の源泉が変化していることを指摘。	mochi_wsj	11	8	1510788331	930939852798935040	https://twitter.com/mochi_wsj/status/930939852798935040

	I never figured out where David Myatt fits, but you can sort of map the outline of the networks of influence.

	And this is the paradox of modern fascism: some of it is simply the truth.

	So we are in a position where the parts of the 1930s German political renaissance which were *good ideas* cannot be recapitulated elsewhere, because when it all went off the rails into horror and madness, those ideas were blamed along with the stuff that exploded.	leashless	1	0	1510792638	930957916781404162	https://twitter.com/leashless/status/930957916781404162			
	And this is the crux of the problem.
