	Can you describe a plausible world in which this assumption turns out to be false, but you can still safely know what's the right version of the software to download if it's a PoW chain?

	And if you're going to argue that attacks are costly because they make the price drop, well that's a social assumption. The exact opposite of absolute security.	VitalikButerin	9	1	1516037196	952955188750442496	https://twitter.com/VitalikButerin/status/952955188750442496			
	> It doesn't matter which frame of reference you come from, the cost of attack is the same. False. For example, if you have more than 23.21% hashpower, then selfish mining attacks are *profitable*.

	Absolutely. Through Affirmative Action, allowing citizens of another country to illegally stay makes our kids 2nd class to DACA illegal aliens. DACA illegal aliens must be repatriated to their country of citizenship. #Nodaca	NetworksManager	28	19	1516025618	952906626708787200	https://twitter.com/NetworksManager/status/952906626708787200		#Nodaca	
	You+ #TrumpTrain are getting played. If the DACA illegal aliens are allowed to stay, future legislation will ensure citizenship. Best thing DACA's can do is have anchor babies, so have 5.

ripple 	Not as confusing as trying to explain that Ripple is the name of a company and a network, but not a digital asset. The digital asset is called $ XRP , not Ripple, even though the logo usually has the word Ripple alongside it. https:// twitter.com/charleskealy/s tatus/952732909571575809 …	haydentiff	74	21	1515984699	952734998276132864	https://twitter.com/haydentiff/status/952734998276132864

bitcoin ripple 	1. > 60% of BTC could be held by one entity and you would never know. 2. $ XRP is finite. 3. Ripple's ledger headers are like #Bitcoin 's block headers, both chain & incorporate txns by hash. 4. Miners have free will over which txn to include or EXCLUDE in a block, unlike with XRP.	haydentiff	59	24	1515983485	952729905967513600	https://twitter.com/haydentiff/status/952729905967513600		#Bitcoin	
	The purpose of escrow is to ensure a predictable supply. That's been set to 1B a month for 55 months. If the $ XRP can be sold to strategic partners who will improve the liquidity or overall improve the health of the $ XRP ecosystem, it will be sold. Otherwise, back into escrow.	haydentiff	3	1	1515982104	952724113365262336	https://twitter.com/haydentiff/status/952724113365262336

bitcoin ripple 	Well, Ripple markets $ XRP to market-makers so I’m not sure why you wrongly assume it’s for banks. People can use $ XRP for any purpose they like.

	"What, exactly, would Trump say? (I suggested a short press release in my TL yesterday.) But there's no way around saying: ""As president, let me assure you that this was a screw up of the Hawaii local authorities.""

	"Except for three things. 1. He should not get in front of the Hawaii governor, or he'd be bigfooting his way into a local issue. 2. There's not much he can say except ""Hawaii screwed up"" 3. He'd screw it up by saying anything at all."	RadioFreeTom	29	0	1515972671	952684551364636672	https://twitter.com/RadioFreeTom/status/952684551364636672			
	Definitely. But you can't make it too idiot proof, because then it's too complicated to work when you need it. And you need the same thing for tsunamis or whatever. This was just a human failure, but in our current environment, everything is about Trump, even stuff that isn't.

	"To summarize: -Had the alert been generated by the military, and sent to the Hawaii EMA, then yes, that's a DC level issue. -A local official hitting the ""oops"" button on a test message is not a DC level issue. That's a Hawaii state govt issue. The End. /7x"	RadioFreeTom	1421	252	1515972352	952683211590643713	https://twitter.com/RadioFreeTom/status/952683211590643713			
	This would be like me tweeting out IMMINENT CHINESE SUBMARINE THREAT TO NEWPORT RI and then expecting that within minutes, the President has been alerted to the presence of the Yangtze off the coast of Middletown. /6	RadioFreeTom	553	85	1515972285	952682932254191617	https://twitter.com/RadioFreeTom/status/952682932254191617			
	"None of this would go to the level of the President, because there was no ""this"" to send to him. This is something that would make his briefing, maybe, later in the day: ""Hey, someone in Honolulu scared the shit out of everyone for a half hour."" No action needed or possible. /5"	RadioFreeTom	602	95	1515972193	952682546785062914	https://twitter.com/RadioFreeTom/status/952682546785062914			
	"Apparently, PACOM - located in Hawaii - saw it, and said ""Uh, guys, that's not actually happening."" So did NORAD. They said so publicly. So did Hawaii EMA. /4"	RadioFreeTom	578	97	1515972141	952682329146785792	https://twitter.com/RadioFreeTom/status/952682329146785792			
	"Instead, a guy in Hawaii who mans the computer that would tell Hawaiians about an attack (or a tsunami, or a whatever) was testing the system and ignored the ""do you really wanna send this one?"" warning, and clicked ""send.""

	If a US military system had detected a missile launch - and had been in error - and needlessly informed Hawaii officials, and panicked everyone, yes, that's a POTUS issue. Because that alert would go to him and he'd see it. That's not what happened. /2	RadioFreeTom	593	113	1515971924	952681417884012544	https://twitter.com/RadioFreeTom/status/952681417884012544			
	Because I actually take being a teacher seriously, I'm gonna walk everyone - one last time - through this Hawaii alert thing, and why it's not a Trump or POTUS issue. Listen carefully, do not @me with dumb interjections, and try to breathe through your nostrils. /1	RadioFreeTom	2357	875	1515971835	952681044636991491	https://twitter.com/RadioFreeTom/status/952681044636991491			@me

	No. This is not the issue. There was nothing happening in channels that would have been used to alert the president. It was a mistake on a Hawaii public safety computer.
