	"The point is that you spending $1 more causes an extra ~$N to be added to the total donation amount.

bitcoin 	"The obfuscated program could be executed on a ""fake chain"" offline so you can't do that literally. You could piggyback off PoW, eg. require the contract to have as input the 1000th ancestor of a bitcoin block of some given height, would make oracle querying cost millions."

	No, justification for hard forking the DAO was that theft is *unambiguously bad*; basically no one supports theft. Anything political is more controversial.	VitalikButerin	22	1	1515215082	949506992191582208	https://twitter.com/VitalikButerin/status/949506992191582208			
ethereum 	Of course ethereum is decentralized so realistically our ability to do anything is limited. We can refuse to help, and we can try to subvert the scheme (eg. with DEXes), but a hard fork to interfere with the scheme would (i) be useless, and (ii) community would not accept it	VitalikButerin	15	3	1515214935	949506375897395206	https://twitter.com/VitalikButerin/status/949506375897395206			
	The pseudorandomness makes it not feasible to use the circuit as an oracle to detect what a vote does, or if two votes are duplicates, but it only has a small influence on the final outcome of the vote.	VitalikButerin	2	0	1515214800	949505809058156545	https://twitter.com/VitalikButerin/status/949505809058156545			
	An obfuscated circuit, which has the private key, decrypts votes, and if >=2 votes have duplicate sender, it only accepts the vote with the highest priority. It then adds up votes, and for each candidate, adds sha3(sorted decrypted votes for that candidate) % 300.

	Everyone makes a vote which contains an encrypted priority number. Setting priority to N requires N-sized proof of work. Votes are encrypted with a public key.	VitalikButerin	4	0	1515214674	949505280777138176	https://twitter.com/VitalikButerin/status/949505280777138176			
	This seems like the sort of thing that could be attacked around the edges. For example, here's a possible scheme using moon math:	VitalikButerin	5	0	1515214611	949505018243121152	https://twitter.com/VitalikButerin/status/949505018243121152

	This is a big part of why I support state-backed cryptocurrencies that use public blockchain-adjacent technologies. Making one that you can't make a smart contract DEX for is *hard*.	VitalikButerin	38	5	1515213513	949500409462190080	https://twitter.com/VitalikButerin/status/949500409462190080			
	"Hard forking is useless; they'll just switch to another system. The more radical thing to do is spin up a decentralized exchange between petro and ETH.

	They can already do that today. This proposal doesn't make it any easier. As long as there are miners willing to mine lower fees, your low fee transaction will be mined. Will just take longer.

	4/ As @pwuille pointed out, out of band fee payments can skew the results. But I think median min fee rate will not be skewed much at all and will be useful. The other important thing is to remove us (developers) from deciding and changing what the min fee and relay fee is.

litecoin 	3/ 2) Miners can choose to not mine low fee transactions to signal to the market to increase the fees. This should help create a fee market. If mining is competitive, this should lead to a good fee market. I'm convinced this will work. I think worthwhile to test on Litecoin.	SatoshiLite	768	131	1515272579	949748150201303040	https://twitter.com/SatoshiLite/status/949748150201303040			
	2/ This accomplishes 2 things. 1) min fee rate is stored in block headers, so SPV clients can look at it to more easily calculate a good fee. For example, median min fee rate of last 100 blocks means that >50% of hashrate will mine that transaction. So it should confirm in 2 blk	SatoshiLite	394	82	1515272409	949747438117535744	https://twitter.com/SatoshiLite/status/949747438117535744			
	1/ Technical info: Use 5 of the version bits (fee_bits) to specify min fee rate min_fee_rate = 2^fee_bits (in litoshi) Soft fork enforces that all transaction in that block has a fee rate higher than min_fee_rate and that fee_bits is set to highest possible. https:// twitter.com/SatoshiLite/st atus/949599651874795520 …	SatoshiLite	1175	318	1515272229	949746681662205952	https://twitter.com/SatoshiLite/status/949746681662205952			
	Median fee is easy to figure out. Just look at last 100 block headers. Then if you pay the median fee, your transactions should confirm in 5 mins (2 blocks) on average.	SatoshiLite	30	6	1515270043	949737515736551424	https://twitter.com/SatoshiLite/status/949737515736551424

	No, the soft fork will enforce that their signal is the lowest txn they accepted.	SatoshiLite	29	2	1515262624	949706397968564224	https://twitter.com/SatoshiLite/status/949706397968564224			
	If 99% of transactions pay 0.001 and 1% is paying 0.00001. Miners can choose to not mine those low fee transactions to encourage users not to pay so little. I *think* it will work, but hard to know for sure. Worth testing it.	SatoshiLite	33	1	1515262549	949706082892398592	https://twitter.com/SatoshiLite/status/949706082892398592			
	Also, at worst, miners just do what they do now. But having their lowest accepted fee rate in the block headers make it much easier for SPV clients to estimate fees by looking at last 100 block fee rate distribution. This will only use up 5 of the version bits.	SatoshiLite	13	2	1515262385	949705396775632897	https://twitter.com/SatoshiLite/status/949705396775632897			
	It's a way for miners to signal. They can give up some money to try to influence higher fees. This will matter more in the long run when fees are a larger percentage of their rewards.	SatoshiLite	49	1	1515262099	949704194331525122	https://twitter.com/SatoshiLite/status/949704194331525122

	They have to set that to the actual lowest fee rate txn they add to their block. They have incentives to set that to their marginal cost. They can of course play games, but if mining is competitive, it should work out.	SatoshiLite	63	6	1515261681	949702442932998145	https://twitter.com/SatoshiLite/status/949702442932998145

	It's a competitive market. If some miners don't mine low fee txns, another can come and mine all of them and taking the fees.	SatoshiLite	32	2	1515261271	949700722328678401	https://twitter.com/SatoshiLite/status/949700722328678401

litecoin 	I'm proposing an upgrade to Litecoin with a soft fork that will let miners signal their min accepted fee in the block header.

litecoin 	For the next release of Litecoin reference client, we will reduce the relay fees from 0.001 LTC/kb ($0.30/kb) to 0.00001 LTC ($0.003/kb). We hope to have that out next week.

	The same way I do. Stock is part of their compensation. All employees should have ownership in the companies they work for. That’s why there is so much wealth inequality.

	A dollar of revenue makes 20% more net profit than before. So if we got an extra 10% last year. We’re so for another 10% this year to get to fair value post earnings growth. Maybe Tepper is right.

	Tax reform exacerbates this imbalance even more by making company ownership even more valuable. Stocks become more valuable by let’s say 20%. Typical profit margin is 10% taxed at say 3.5% for a net of 6.5%. Now it nets 8%. Which is 20% higher than 6.5%. Simple math...

	With no good ipos. Tons of stock buybacks and new inflows going straight into ETFs have pushed average PE ratios higher just on more supply of cash versus low supply of stocks.

	Also with indexing it becomes more of a currency of stocks than an investment in a company. So performance becomes more uniform. Money flows in. All stocks go up. Money flows out they all go down.

	This is a theory I’m thinking about. Many exciting new companies stay private. Limiting the supply of good investments for the public. Good public companies have more demand for their stock.

	I was thinking that maybe we just have to accept that the lack of new supply of quality IPOs, share buybacks and tons of cheap capital has shifted what a PE should be.

bitcoin ripple 	Sheesh! My point about misinformed bitcoin reporting is NOT whataboutism. It’s to say that many journos misunderstand all of this — bitcoin, crypto, blockchain, Ripple, all of it!

	"Well, partly, yes. ""Bullshit"" implies a deliberate lie. But it wasn't the only part of that tweet that led a mob to wrongly assume the journalist had simply made his story up.

	Nixon used to say Americans wanted to know their president isn't a crook. They also want to know he's not a lunatic.

	I'd argue it is direct and it operates much like Trump's belittling nicknames, not on a rational level but subtly changing how people approach and think about the personalities involved.
