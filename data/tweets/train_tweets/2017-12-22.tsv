	OK Everyone ... stop panicking about the across the board dip in cryptocurrencies. It's Christmas for f-ck sake. The costliest time of the year. People are cashing in to buy presents which no-one wants or ever uses but pretends to be thankful for. After Xmas - big boom.	officialmcafee	15724	4788	1513972377	944294707823300608	https://twitter.com/officialmcafee/status/944294707823300608			
litecoin ethereum 	Yes, there are 1,500+ coins now. And yes, most are jokes or outright scams. But among those coins are Ethereum, Monero, Litecoin and other proven winners. By implying Sether is a joke is a huge mistake. Go to sether.io and read it. You will see it is in the mold of a winner.	officialmcafee	913	137	1513969725	944283584000659461	https://twitter.com/officialmcafee/status/944283584000659461

	No. Sether can't be purchased on an exchange right now. It is an Initial Coin Offering (ICO). If you are looking to make 100% overnight then an ICO is not for you.

bitcoin 	Fellow Bitcoiners, are you ever going to realize how problematic these fees are getting? Avg fees now over $40 per tx. A year ago avg fee was $4. A year prior, $0.40.

bitcoin 	creating a stupid multi-year argument by failing at psychology 101 is.

	I think some people maybe trying to make fees worse thinking it creates political pressure to force a moral hazard decision.

bitcoin 	Olivier, you're a prime example of what I was talking about: people who spend their time telling lies online.

bitcoin 	if some people create drama to demand that all of bitcoin degrades to this weaker security model maybe it's better if they opt-in than creating drama. a few protocol R & D people I asked for thoughts on it did not seem keen - like want to protect people from opt-in weak security.	adam3us	3	0	1513931700	944124098522812416	https://twitter.com/adam3us/status/944124098522812416			
	then you'd have a huge Gavinesque blocksize and basically no one would check it outside of data-centers. If people want to opt-into that, they could do it as a kind of opt-in sidechain.

	Note that I'm not suggesting betting on cryptokitties or that they are a good investment.

	Paradoxically, cryptokitties are a better SoV than BTC, because kitties are art, and artwork actually has an inherent value. I'll pay a few cents for a pretty, custom cat pic, and so will most others.

	In contrast, a futures contract is a standard contract, and it entitles the person holding it at maturity to delivery of the underlying goods. Any price discrepancy between the future contract price and the underlying item is settled through arbitrage.

	Yes, that's my understanding. In a prediction market, there is a free-form bet (contract) that is unique to each contract, and typically an arbiter (oracle) to determine which side won. Winner takes the loser's money, upside/downside are capped.	el33th4xor	2	0	1513907702	944023443405705217	https://twitter.com/el33th4xor/status/944023443405705217

	That's not to say I want or like high fees ($4800 is insane!)

ripple 	Even if you're separately verifying downloads with PGP, HTTPs over HTTP provides: 1) redundant protection in case the PGP layer is compromised (lots of PGP keys were crippled by the recent Infineon RSA exploit) 2) privacy (often less than you'd expect due to traffic analysis).https://twitter.com/ahzf/status/943921271540248576 …	peterktodd	24	10	1513960824	944246251784085505	https://twitter.com/peterktodd/status/944246251784085505

	Distinguish your trades from your investments. One way I do this is by having 2 seperate portfolios: -> Trading Portfolio -> Long term investment portfolio Knowing your time horizon for a play will help you cut a losing trade vs knowing to hodl an investment through volatility.
