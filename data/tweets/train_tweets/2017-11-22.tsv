	That sounds like a bad idea. Buyers and providers will in very many cases be totally different sets of people.

	I think the decentralization and micro-payments are important. For a few reasons: 1. Ability to bootstrap around existing crypto community 2. Incentive to download the app 3.

	This is an actually useful product and will help ppl at (i) conferences, (ii) airports, malls, other crowded places... That bootstraps network effect, keep going from there.

bitcoin 	The Bitcoin community ultimately split over the ideologies of whether “Store of Value” (Bitcoin) or “Utility” (Bitcoin Cash) has the bigger long term upside.

	Think logically of all the parts in the gas engine and all the money you spend on repairs of a 5 year old car. This is not how an electric car performs. There is no engine. power is applied right to the wheels, the breaks are regenerative.

	Because we learned some very interesting information about actual wear on Tesla vehicles over time. Real data.

	What people don’t get is there is no depreciation on the truck. It can go 2 mil miles. The cost per mile used continues to decrease over time.
