	They might trade if on GDAX as it can be quite profitable. To list on Coinbase, they would need very good liquidity on GDAX because that's where they source their coins from.

bitcoin 	If the problems stemmed from high fees and high latencies, we are working on better protocols. BCH has reparameterized Bitcoin to reduce both, Bitcoin NG and ByzCoin address onchain scale even further.	el33th4xor	3	0	1513406309	941920446932508672	https://twitter.com/el33th4xor/status/941920446932508672			
	No, they involve private communication, and you have no standing other than prurient interest to want to read other people's emails. It's weird that you ask.	el33th4xor	0	0	1513406173	941919879564877826	https://twitter.com/el33th4xor/status/941919879564877826			
	Yes, of course I do. And I'm by no means the only person saying this. This isn't some amazing new revelation. A large number of people who don't toe a particular line have been saying the exact same thing about their experience.	el33th4xor	0	0	1513405851	941918526654296065	https://twitter.com/el33th4xor/status/941918526654296065

Feel free to DM if you like.	el33th4xor	0	0	1513405496	941917036715888640	https://twitter.com/el33th4xor/status/941917036715888640

	I urge everyone to be liberal with blocks. If someone is being toxic, **to anyone**, just block. Twitter timelines don't have to be a cesspool of stupidity, trolling and brigading. We live in the age of perception control and astroturf. Blocks are the only effective remedy.	el33th4xor	93	14	1513404005	941910786359771136	https://twitter.com/el33th4xor/status/941910786359771136			
	The rest are independently badly behaved. They didn't learn their bad manners in a slack channel or troll school. They aren't reading their toxic material off of a laminated card issued by a company. Yes, that company. They chose to make their name by being toxic.	el33th4xor	26	3	1513403866	941910200868655104	https://twitter.com/el33th4xor/status/941910200868655104			
	My timeline is readable now that i blocked about 200 ppl. Around 110 are professional trolls, manned by 20 or so people, paid by a company. Yes, that company.	el33th4xor	44	7	1513403729	941909627008094208	https://twitter.com/el33th4xor/status/941909627008094208			
	I have blocked people for liking toxic tweets. This is the only strategy I know for pushing back on the coward brigades that are all to common on social media. If someone is an ass, and someone else likes that, they are both part of the problem.	el33th4xor	49	6	1513403647	941909281456173056	https://twitter.com/el33th4xor/status/941909281456173056			
	I'm very liberal with Likes, and similarly liberal with Blocks. Life is incredibly short, and there's no need to waste it on people who are not acting in good faith, or not engaging respectfully with others.	el33th4xor	49	9	1513403524	941908765015789568	https://twitter.com/el33th4xor/status/941908765015789568			
	Whining about being blocked by me is grounds enough to be blocked by me. No one has a right to other people's time. If your net contribution to my timeline is negativity or stupidity, I'll block. If you don't like that, try to say more interesting or insightful things.	el33th4xor	220	21	1513402974	941906458681249792	https://twitter.com/el33th4xor/status/941906458681249792

	I also see it as overly greedy and will create deficits. They could have lower Corp rates to 22% or 25% and given more to individuals. Better for economy.	GerberKawasaki	2	1	1513441525	942068154158653440	https://twitter.com/GerberKawasaki/status/942068154158653440			
	Good question. Yes and no. The final version is the best version presented at least. I’m for lower Corp tax rates and lower income tax rates. I’m not for the way they are paying for it.

	9. That attestation service validates the enclave's signature, returning a success/failure message, then signed with an Intel key. However, nothing prevents Intel from being compelled to sign a falsified response! A client would have no way of telling the difference.	AriannaSimpson	19	6	1513396309	941878504680972289	https://twitter.com/AriannaSimpson/status/941878504680972289			
	"8. In the case of Intel's SGX, the issue is even worse because even if the hardware isn't compromised, every remote attestation uses ""Intel Attestation Service"", which isn't end-to-end protected."	AriannaSimpson	25	5	1513396309	941878503372234753	https://twitter.com/AriannaSimpson/status/941878503372234753			
	7. This is true of any remote attestation scheme, as documented here: https://www.blackhat.com/docs/us-17/thursday/us-17-Swami-SGX-Remote-Attestation-Is-Not-Sufficient-wp.pdf …	AriannaSimpson	20	2	1513396308	941878502093078528	https://twitter.com/AriannaSimpson/status/941878502093078528			
	6. One downside is that it creates really strong incentives for someone to find a vulnerability of any kind, including in the hardware.	AriannaSimpson	18	0	1513395943	941876968626077696	https://twitter.com/AriannaSimpson/status/941876968626077696			
	5. The fact that it's using Intel's SGX (more in the whitepaper, though it's super short and I'd definitely be curious to dig into more of the details once they release an updated or expanded version) is an interesting approach.	AriannaSimpson	11	1	1513395942	941876967552335872	https://twitter.com/AriannaSimpson/status/941876967552335872			
	4. Back to MobileCoin -- once of my concerns is that they have a federated approach, so they're making a clear decentralization tradeoff for the sake of efficiency.

Right now we have a regulatory challenge with using them for transactional purposes given the cap gains situation, but hopefully the bill in Congress to exclude transactions under $600 is passed, which will help.
