bitcoin 	Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash now seems to have become inversely correlated, post Segwit2x. If you have coins in long term cold storage, you are fine.

	That's like arguing that everyone in the world should use a Mac and not Windows, but unsurprisingly, they don't.

	"cell phones used to be expensive and heavy. now big parts of the world have only cell phones, never had fixed lines. tech improves and gets cheaper. you dont sell tech by making it not fit for purpose. your & falkvinge's version is to sell plastic toy phones asap ""there fixed it"""	adam3us	84	17	1510411668	929360014866710532	https://twitter.com/adam3us/status/929360014866710532			
bitcoin 	so bitcoin is cheaper payments? you realise many countries have free instant domestic wires, free checking accounts, free debit cards etc. how are you going to compete with free? banks can offer cash-back. can Bitcoin? I dont think so. need to focus on differentiation.	adam3us	96	22	1510411315	929358531630735361	https://twitter.com/adam3us/status/929358531630735361			
	timing depends on specification, review, implementation, testing and other work, and how much volunteer time there is available. yes both MAST and schnorr aggregation are soft-forks and easier/safer with the script versioning feature of segwit.	adam3us	25	4	1510410317	929354344771698688	https://twitter.com/adam3us/status/929354344771698688

	But 2MB is 2MB. It would be a bit more logical if xapo had integrated segwit, batching, fee estimation, utxo consolidation. But not doing any? of them and then saying oh and now we must do alts - how does it make sense to switch? Alts don't scale any differently.	adam3us	4	1	1510380711	929230169570623488	https://twitter.com/adam3us/status/929230169570623488			
bitcoin 	Bitcoin is FOSS, surprisingly many people in Bitcoin are not familiar with FOSS work flows. in other FOSS industries companies have a senior engineer contribute so they have someone to translate and explain limitations and future direction. good companies do this in Bitcoin too.https://twitter.com/fluffypony/status/928990613013282817 …	adam3us	253	78	1510366269	929169595268657152	https://twitter.com/adam3us/status/929169595268657152			
bitcoin 	Lots of Bitcoin news queued: lightning, segwit adoption, schnorr aggregation and institutional interest. People who incorrectly focus on chain scale can buy the BCH dividend and be happy. And Bitcoin can go back to work.	adam3us	507	189	1510365242	929165290553954305	https://twitter.com/adam3us/status/929165290553954305			
bitcoin 	I am calling $10k by end of year now the fork drama is resolved. Would have been a bit better to see B2X fail technically and in the market. But seeing BCH do the same is ok too. Take the dividend, buy Bitcoin, buy any dips, HODL. I don't really think of smaller than 20% a dip.	adam3us	458	158	1510365125	929164798792753152	https://twitter.com/adam3us/status/929164798792753152			
bitcoin 	c) Bitcoin's differentiated value proposition becomes better understood, better valued by the market, and tech with more scale and scalability via layer1+layer2 scale+more fungibilty & privacy. The value proposition benefits from fungibility, privacy and decentralisation.	adam3us	32	8	1510364942	929164029796519936	https://twitter.com/adam3us/status/929164029796519936			
	I would be more worried for people like @ jgarzik and NYA making known to them as false and misleading statements that caused many people who bought B2X to lose money.

	Important to note that production isn't equal to arrival at stores as there's always some at logistics channels.

	また、増産する場合、いじれる数字は数カ月後のものだけ。1800万の報道が色々出た後その後ぱたっと出なくなりましたが、それは今期の上限が決まったから。故に金融業界では今期物理的に売れる数字のイメージが既にあり、株価に織り込まれ、注目は来期の計画へ。とりま年末商戦ですかね。	mochi_wsj	7	4	1510419342	929392201007693824	https://twitter.com/mochi_wsj/status/929392201007693824			
	先日の記事、「生産＝販売」ではないことにご留意を。倉庫や船や飛行機に載っている分があるからです。今期の数字に関しては1600→1800→2000を打診（でも部品不足で無理だった）と書いてきましたが、任天堂が今期1400売ろうとしていることを考慮していただけると、なんとなくイメージ湧くでしょうか。	mochi_wsj	9	4	1510418986	929390706732417024	https://twitter.com/mochi_wsj/status/929390706732417024

	Tual's non apologies after the DAO may have been legal advice, but they were nauseating to watch. I felt ashamed to have told people we could be trusted. Parity did better...

	The real issue is this. Tual and Gav have shipped technical errors that cost a quarter billion of other people's money.

	Yes, and sending value through Google Spreadsheets is cheaper as well.

	For those who need help understand my tongue in cheek - Most other tokens/coins and bank chains are highly centralized and not censorship resistant.
