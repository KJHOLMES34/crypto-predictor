bitcoin 	"If they still think it could have worked ""if only miners supported"", then it would seem they still didn't draw the right lessons. To be clear I think most people, from a variety of opinions, learned something from 2x and UASF. And Bitcoin is stronger for it."	adam3us	16	4	1512060105	936274057682550784	https://twitter.com/adam3us/status/936274057682550784			
	It's a labour theory of value fallacy. We told them miner support is philosophical, and miners would not lose $300m/month. Also the miners told them that publicly if they chose to listen. There is no surprise here, just economic reality catching up with them.	adam3us	15	3	1512059963	936273462770810880	https://twitter.com/adam3us/status/936273462770810880			
	Everyone understands that now. Except maybe a couple of people chasing the idea of forcing a change, who temporarily bamboozled themselves that if only they could make pact with miners they could force it on the ecosystem despite very clear lack of consensus.	adam3us	18	4	1512059806	936272805884080128	https://twitter.com/adam3us/status/936272805884080128

	"I'm noticing an odd comparison: segwit is a simple and safe upgrade and yet they are ""no ready"", yet 2x was an incompatible and complex to split fork they were supporting. Would they have survived it? Or would they be still offline a month later?"	adam3us	65	13	1512058512	936267375938174976	https://twitter.com/adam3us/status/936267375938174976

bitcoin 	Bitcoin has or is evolving through several stages of value transfer: 1. small value transfers at layer 1 when Bitcoin was a tiny niche (10,000 BTC for a pizza) 2. larger value txs as wealth flow increases and small txs get priced out of layer 1 3. small value txs at layer 2https://twitter.com/NickSzabo4/status/936361211280502784 …	NickSzabo4	1370	583	1512081345	936363146909908992	https://twitter.com/NickSzabo4/status/936363146909908992			
	"Economists' terminology is misleading though since ""store"" of value is impossible without benefit from transferring that value.

	yes, but Coinbase will have no idea you moved it to your own Cold Storage (unless they specifically ask you).

	And that, I suspect, is why conservative Republicans who criticize and oppose Trump generate such special frustration and anger from his supporters.	prchovanec	10	3	1512077437	936346754471071747	https://twitter.com/prchovanec/status/936346754471071747			
	One of the main reasons I remain outspoken, against Trump, AS A REPUBLICAN, is that I want others who share my misgivings to see that they are not alone. That it is perfectly acceptable for a conservative Republican to criticize and oppose Trump.	prchovanec	30	10	1512077384	936346532248522752	https://twitter.com/prchovanec/status/936346532248522752			
	I'm not saying that many of his supporters object to his clownishness per se (though some do find it off-putting).

	The truth is that Trump own undeniable clownishness has done more to discredit him, in this respect, than all of his critics combined. But highlighting this clownishness is still useful.	prchovanec	2	1	1512077220	936345845812858882	https://twitter.com/prchovanec/status/936345845812858882			
	People are often influenced by what other people are saying around them, what is popular or acceptable to say.

	I was deeply critical of Obama ignoring the UK and NATO.

	Theresa May told Trump he was wrong to tweet nut-case videos, but let him off the hook and kept with the state visit. He has doubled-down - of course - by insulting her.

	On the other hand, a guy on my Ireland flight admitted (he was a grad student in Boston) that he popped over to Europe to party for a weekend. As long as that happens, airlines will gladly sell cheap, small seats to people who want them while the rest of us suffer.
