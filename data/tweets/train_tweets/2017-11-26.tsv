	This is all the more true given the socio-economic status of the families. Guess the kids paid probably more than a migrants average monthly wage to send their kids to this pre-school.

	2. Don't mess with a Chinese kid. Crimes against children are treated harshly everywhere but even more so in China where most families still only have one child.
