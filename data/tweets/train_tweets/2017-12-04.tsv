	In theory not all wallets will be hacked at once. You'd be able to. But like other forks your key would access a wallet on both versions. The market would then price the coins differently in each version. Old fork if those keys are not compromised you could sell those coins...	sytaylor	0	0	1512403189	937713059149369345	https://twitter.com/sytaylor/status/937713059149369345			
	Switching signature is used - as it has been explained to me requires a hard fork, but I suspect should such a threat arise moving to that fork would be in the interests of all parties (vs say, block size debate)	sytaylor	1	0	1512401650	937706603083653121	https://twitter.com/sytaylor/status/937706603083653121
