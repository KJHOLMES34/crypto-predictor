	To be clear, there are certainly ways national governments are now taxing # crypto, but these policies aren’t nearly as baked into regulator’s minds as other assets - with the work of @ coincenter & friends I think we still have time to reach a optimal code, especially for *users*	cburniske	33	6	1514460623	946342563216285696	https://twitter.com/cburniske/status/946342563216285696		#	@	0.18	0.886	0
	With # crypto we have created a new subset of capital that falls under no predefined inheritance pattern or tiers of taxation, making it the most unencumbered asset class we have.	cburniske	130	31	1514459547	946338048446550017	https://twitter.com/cburniske/status/946338048446550017		#		0.16	0.3774	0

bitcoin 	Protip: you don't hear details about Bitcoin's most important use-cases because opsec. Posting details about those Venezuelans puts them at risk of getting thrown in jail.
