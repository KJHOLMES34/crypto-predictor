ripple 	Yes: if Y pays A via Ripple, ownership is recorded in the path. If Y pays A outside of Ripple, the $ system is what recorded ownership.	peterktodd	0	0	1495920569	868579940471627776	https://twitter.com/peterktodd/status/868579940471627776				0.11	0.2009	0
ripple 	Note that Ripple can only do that *because* the currencies being transferred already have global consensus - a requirement of a currency.	peterktodd	0	0	1495919800	868576714175254531	https://twitter.com/peterktodd/status/868576714175254531				0.14	0.0	0
bitcoin ripple 	The difference is in Bitcoin, X pays Y something that A and B might accept later. In Ripple, A->B and X->Y can be different currencies.	peterktodd	3	0	1495919744	868576478623129601	https://twitter.com/peterktodd/status/868576478623129601				0.12	0.1909	0
ripple 	Remember that in Ripple the focus is on payments of other currencies, not an in-system token.	peterktodd	0	0	1495919056	868573591700467712	https://twitter.com/peterktodd/status/868573591700467712				0.31	0.0	0
ripple 	The original Ripple system took the opposite approach - you needed to have consensus with your peers, but non-peers were ~irrelevant to you.	peterktodd	0	0	1495919002	868573367414161410	https://twitter.com/peterktodd/status/868573367414161410				-0.04	0.1655	0

bitcoin 	Yes, Bitcoin needs global consensus because it's a store of value. A payment system OTOH doesn't necessarily need global consensus.	peterktodd	0	0	1495918284	868570355648131073	https://twitter.com/peterktodd/status/868570355648131073				-0.35	0.3125	0
