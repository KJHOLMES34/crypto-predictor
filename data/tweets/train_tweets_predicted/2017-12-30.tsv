bitcoin 	Bitcoin continues to hold 12k over and over. If for any reason we break 12k again the next break may see 8k quickly. If for any reason 8k breaks it may be time to start thinking about another 90% decline back to where it was 2 years ago.

	"what I have learned in crypto land from twitter.. is what ever is trading on twitter as HOT HOT HOT.. crashes 7 days later over last 3 months... XRP was buying pushed HARD this week at 2.0.. as the next ""much buy""... (because it went up a lot..) means XRP crash is at hand.."

bitcoin 	Impressive.. while I am not saying 800.. I know 90% of crypto zombies assume bitcoin hits 8000 at worse if 12k breaks(it is).. to me that says 8000 breaks and we see 3000 or 5000.. to blown up all the chasers of last half yearhttps://twitter.com/russian_market/status/947052697651499008 …	Bamabroker	24	3	1514640464	947096868743458816	https://twitter.com/Bamabroker/status/947096868743458816				-0.04	-0.2384	0
