bitcoin 	. @ mrhodl is a bitcoin HODLer.

bitcoin 	creating a stupid multi-year argument by failing at psychology 101 is.

bitcoin 	if some people create drama to demand that all of bitcoin degrades to this weaker security model maybe it's better if they opt-in than creating drama. a few protocol R & D people I asked for thoughts on it did not seem keen - like want to protect people from opt-in weak security.	adam3us	3	0	1513931700	944124098522812416	https://twitter.com/adam3us/status/944124098522812416				-0.08	0.033	0

	Note that I'm not suggesting betting on cryptokitties or that they are a good investment. I'm saying something stronger: as ridiculous an investment as the kitties may seem, they are still a better SoV than a coin you can't transact.	el33th4xor	41	2	1513958393	944236057503166465	https://twitter.com/el33th4xor/status/944236057503166465				0.05	0.4496	0

	No, the cryptokitty market isn't that deep so that strategy would not scale. I would not store value as BTC -- the devs have left the Science station and are now off the rails, toasting champagne to high fees. ETH and BCH can be legitimate SoVs with increasing adoption.	el33th4xor	1	0	1513957643	944232908453269511	https://twitter.com/el33th4xor/status/944232908453269511				-0.10	-0.0846	0
	Speaking of cryptokitties: do they have a lifetime? Genetic diseases? Or are we going to be inundated with an exponentially increasing number of cryptokitties?	el33th4xor	27	2	1513957216	944231119767134209	https://twitter.com/el33th4xor/status/944231119767134209				0.04	0.0257	0
	Paradoxically, cryptokitties are a better SoV than BTC, because kitties are art, and artwork actually has an inherent value. I'll pay a few cents for a pretty, custom cat pic, and so will most others. A coin that you cannot transact in because the fees are high captures no value.	el33th4xor	66	10	1513957165	944230906075734017	https://twitter.com/el33th4xor/status/944230906075734017				0.04	0.3739	0

bitcoin 	If bitcoin was to drop 8000 here. Coinbase would stop all trading for a week. Until they could be sure buyers would come in and it open up. They are ONLY about protecting their made up token exchange. Nothing else.	Bamabroker	21	4	1513960260	944243886398074880	https://twitter.com/Bamabroker/status/944243886398074880				-0.23	-0.0502	0
bitcoin 	Watch. Bitcoin goes up 1500 bucks and magically they allow trading. Coinbase is at the center of the scam. To keep Ponzi scam going. Prices are not real if your only allowed to buy smoothly.

bitcoin 	Strongly disagree.. while TV pushes the idea gold was hit by bitcoin.. that is NOT true... gold was hurt by tax plan passing and that causing rate spike since aug..
