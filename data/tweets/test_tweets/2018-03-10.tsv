ripple 	It’s not an offer from Ripple. It kind of looks like some guy might be trying to scam people. He might, for example, be trying to sell XRP by telling people it’s shares in the company. IDK, but it seems off. I’m going to ask around.	haydentiff	0	0	1520714193	972571934528548864	https://twitter.com/haydentiff/status/972571934528548864			
bitcoin ripple 	Bitcoin succeeded despite some people NOT using it for gambling or drugs.

	No no no. Edge doesn’t hold, touch, or even know about user funds. But we are always looking for 3rd parties to partner with. We’ve had a few insurance services reach out. I don’t think they were P2P though. I suddenly remembered about Karma Coverage 5 minutes ago.	haydentiff	2	0	1520706858	972541170978033664	https://twitter.com/haydentiff/status/972541170978033664
