	That said, if we have a solid double bottom formation in the $5500-$6000 range, then I will be probably go bullish on BTC, but no expectations that we will see $20k for many months to come, if at all, this year. That said, reaching & holding $5500 is a big “IF” at this point.	VinnyLingham	132	16	1522301105	979227927312248832	https://twitter.com/VinnyLingham/status/979227927312248832			
bitcoin ethereum 	Ethereum’s recent fall is somewhat supporting BTC as a reliable crypto store of value, but when ETH bottoms, then there is less of a cushioning effect for Bitcoin fiat liquidity demands will put extra pressure on BTC. We’re seeing some semblance of that right now in the market.	VinnyLingham	78	7	1522301105	979227924896329728	https://twitter.com/VinnyLingham/status/979227924896329728			
bitcoin 	The emergence of a trustless StableCoin will put extra pressure on Bitcoin if exchanges start listing trading pairs against StableCoins, and then alts start trading primarily against USD and other major fiat currencies. Do not underestimate the amount of trading pair arbitrage.	VinnyLingham	44	8	1522301104	979227922878926848	https://twitter.com/VinnyLingham/status/979227922878926848			
bitcoin 	In general, I think this is a healthy period of consolidation for crypto, and we’ll be better for it. The question really is will it last a few month, or until next year. Biggest risks for breaking the Feb 6 support will be if Bitcoin decouples and then miner profitability.	VinnyLingham	94	7	1522301104	979227920257470464	https://twitter.com/VinnyLingham/status/979227920257470464			
bitcoin 	I feel that Bitcoin has to double bottom at $5500-6000, range to end the bear market, and start a consolidation period with an new uptrend. If it breaks support below that, other risks emerge and if it doesn’t get there, the market may be volatile for a while longer.

	If you want a peer to peer currency, it makes sense that it's peer to peer. If you care about instant transactions then of course the recipient needs to be online, otherwise why care about instant.

	"There's a very good term for your narrower meaning, ""default risk"". There is no need to use two terms to mean the same thing & thereby mislead readers into ignoring very important risks involved in credit, which is what normal think when they hear the term ""credit risks."""

	Lowering the value of collateral also effects the costs of collection and the costs of recovering upon default on the loan, and those are also credit risks.	NickSzabo4	0	0	1522346411	979417953786511360	https://twitter.com/NickSzabo4/status/979417953786511360			
	Indeed, inflation risk, even when attempts are made to hedge it with e.g. an index, comes with the risk that inflation will be measured inaccurately. Such measurement faces fundamental problems such as the subjectivity of preferences.	NickSzabo4	1	0	1522346089	979416602037796866	https://twitter.com/NickSzabo4/status/979416602037796866			
	People in the private credit business don't make up separate artificial categories of risk and then claim their debt carries no credit risk. Only government bond propagandists do that.	NickSzabo4	2	0	1522345778	979415299526021121	https://twitter.com/NickSzabo4/status/979415299526021121			
	"That's not how people use the term ""credit risk"" in other contexts besides the propaganda context of the bonds of one's favorite government(s).

	"If you can't see how using the most powerful country in the world as the single example extremely biased, and how this artificial distinction between ""credit risk"" and ""valuation risk"" misleads readers, you are simply spewing propaganda and meaningful conversation is impossible."

	"But ""no credit risk"" usually is not discussed in such a context, it is just used dishonestly as it was in the above use of this lide.
