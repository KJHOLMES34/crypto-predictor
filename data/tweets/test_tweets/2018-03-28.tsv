	Good point. The founders clearly intended a well-armed militia to use only such weapons was they are able to carry, so shoulder-launched SAM good, but two-person wire-guided anti-tank bad.	dgwbirch	1	0	1522244821	978991853449064449	https://twitter.com/dgwbirch/status/978991853449064449			
	If you want to arm your militia to stop the government from billeting troops in their houses, or whatever, a pickup truck full of AR-15s isn’t going to stop a Maverick.

	"Thanks! But (also FWIW) I think supply chains (mistrusting entities that have both conflicting and shared interests) are ideal use cases for this notion of blockchain consensus. Of course, It helps that we're not dogmatic on ""trustlessness"" and have a flexible view of truth :)"	mikejcasey	2	0	1522203705	978819402039689221	https://twitter.com/mikejcasey/status/978819402039689221

	The most important truths are those built on consensus. A common understanding upon which we all faithfully enter into economic exchanges. Especially in finance and money, we rely on agreed-on estimates. (What exactly is the TRUE GDP of the U.S. or Apple's TRUE 2018 earnings?	mikejcasey	4	0	1522201761	978811248279261184	https://twitter.com/mikejcasey/status/978811248279261184			
	In case anyone's wondering, we stand by the title of our book. A read of it will show why. No, blockchains can't resolve problems of absolute truth. Yes, it can contain lies.

	13/ Neither # crypto, nor the regulators, are going away	cburniske	79	7	1522243111	978984682091155456	https://twitter.com/cburniske/status/978984682091155456		#	
	12/ in short, # crypto evolves at a speed unlike any other asset class, placing it outside the control of any nation-state & requiring a dynamic regulatory approach. We, the industry, must welcome working w/ regulators, as opposed to knee-jerk categorizing them as the enemy.	cburniske	79	25	1522243056	978984450083127296	https://twitter.com/cburniske/status/978984450083127296		#	
	11/ Anarchists and libertarians can call me a sell-out, but the state *always* plays a role in any technological revolution. Just ask @ CarlotaPrzPerez.	cburniske	49	3	1522242553	978982342193766400	https://twitter.com/cburniske/status/978982342193766400			@
	10/ and the toxic attitude toward regulators and the state has to go if we want to take # crypto mainstream.	cburniske	34	8	1522242464	978981969840300033	https://twitter.com/cburniske/status/978981969840300033		#	
	9/ of course, there are many learnings # crypto can borrow from when we were dealing with the birth of other asset classes, such as equities in the 17th century—or perhaps more applicable, ways in which we regulated the internet on a supranational basis (eg, ICANN)	cburniske	15	6	1522242355	978981509788028928	https://twitter.com/cburniske/status/978981509788028928		#	
	8/ We must come up with 21st century regulatory mechanisms to place guardrails on a 21st century asset class.	cburniske	57	15	1522242196	978980846001643521	https://twitter.com/cburniske/status/978980846001643521			
	7/ I mean this with zero incendiary tone: # cryptoassets cannot be controlled—as software spawned assets, they move too fast.	cburniske	38	4	1522242073	978980329737224193	https://twitter.com/cburniske/status/978980329737224193		#	
	6/ From a regulatory angle, this means we cannot approach # crypto from a centralized perspective. It would be like trying to patch an oil tanker’s hull with bubble gum.	cburniske	38	7	1522241838	978979343996215296	https://twitter.com/cburniske/status/978979343996215296		#	
	5/ This is not a knock on @ CoinMarketCap, nor an endorsement of @ wavesplatform, but rather an example of how viral and sprawling activity & experimentation is within the # cryptoasset ecosystem.	cburniske	36	5	1522241585	978978281033695232	https://twitter.com/cburniske/status/978978281033695232		#	@ @
	4/ regardless of what you think of the quality of any of these assets, the fact still remains that @ wavesplatform has ~10x as many tokens listed on its DEX as @ CoinMarketCap represents as the entire # cryptoasset reality.	cburniske	26	9	1522241492	978977892133670912	https://twitter.com/cburniske/status/978977892133670912		#	@ @
	3/ consider, for example, that @ wavesplatform has 12,297 # tokens that have been launched on its platform and trade on its internal DEX.pic.twitter.com/Uir2WwFVlK	cburniske	47	20	1522241228	978976783885357056	https://twitter.com/cburniske/status/978976783885357056		#	@
	2/ When people new to the space first realize @ CoinMarketCap has ~1,500 # cryptoassets listed, many will exclaim, “Wow, that’s a lot!” But in reality, that’s just the tip of the iceberg...	cburniske	31	8	1522241144	978976432452980736	https://twitter.com/cburniske/status/978976432452980736		#	@
	1/ While I appreciate the work of @ CoinMarketCap & the many other token data aggregators, it’s important to recognize none of them represent the entire # cryptoasset reality.	cburniske	252	83	1522240930	978975534163034113	https://twitter.com/cburniske/status/978975534163034113		#	@
