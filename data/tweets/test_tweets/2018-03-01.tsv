	My mom passed away earlier this week. Regardless of what happens in crypto over the next week or so, please don’t mistake my silence for anything other than me needing some time to disconnect and mourn.

litecoin 	In my opinion, you bought LTC for the wrong reason. Litecoin shouldn't depend on one company or one person to succeed.	SatoshiLite	10	2	1519934399	969301242890543104	https://twitter.com/SatoshiLite/status/969301242890543104

litecoin 	That's fine. I don't need to prove it. You should own LTC only because you believe in the project. I am not the project. If you don't like this dynamic, you should probably sell the coin. People should ask themselves what they can do for Litecoin instead.	SatoshiLite	20	7	1519934248	969300609751859200	https://twitter.com/SatoshiLite/status/969300609751859200			
litecoin 	That again? Litecoin is my creation. I have more incentives than anyone for it to succeed. Money is not a big incentive for me. But I don't have to explain that to anyone as I don't work for investors.	SatoshiLite	17	3	1519934042	969299746618712064	https://twitter.com/SatoshiLite/status/969299746618712064

litecoin 	Stop caring about me or what I say. If Litecoin is good, it will succeed irrespective of my twitter account.	SatoshiLite	18	3	1519869694	969029849225441280	https://twitter.com/SatoshiLite/status/969029849225441280			
litecoin 	Maybe you should follow a 2nd account that only tweets positive Litecoin news and leave me be me. It will make me happier.	SatoshiLite	80	3	1519867605	969021089484488710	https://twitter.com/SatoshiLite/status/969021089484488710

	Yes, Paul. Perhaps my short piece needed a little more nuance. As I said to @ TaxMasterTax, I agree that new important roles will be carved for accountants, but certain functions, widely used today, will either go away or change dramatically.

	Yeah, I thought of you Daniel. Also think you're right. As of now accountants are greatly needed in the development of these systems and many will see their jobs morph into new roles as a result.

	Yep. You might be right. Way too early to tell. One thing seems clear to me though. As @ NSmolenski just pointed out, we are now compelled to think about the very nature of social consensus around perceived facts.

bitcoin 	It is focused on the proper sequencing of transactions, on whether a bitcoin has been double- spent or not. And a good blockchain does that far more reliably than a centralized ledger.
