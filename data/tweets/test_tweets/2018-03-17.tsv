	If X is much lower, then the cost to attack is much lower as an attacker can just pay a little more than X to subvert your chain. In that case it's much less secure. What you say is an impossibility economically.	jimmysong	69	6	1521320665	975115664619958272	https://twitter.com/jimmysong/status/975115664619958272

	You're expecting the market to act exactly the way you centrally design it to be?

	8/ That's not to say Staking has no place. Certainly, it can be utilized judiciously for other things. But to make it the lynchpin of a blockchain simply does not make sense. /fin	jimmysong	155	18	1521305124	975050479427379200	https://twitter.com/jimmysong/status/975050479427379200			
	7/ You replace the known costs with unknown costs and that gives people plausible deniability and makes them feel good. That's not virtue, that's intellectual laziness at best and cowardice at worst.	jimmysong	207	23	1521305010	975050003206066177	https://twitter.com/jimmysong/status/975050003206066177			
	"6/ So why do people like PoS so much? Much like electric cars, it makes them feel good. Electric cars still need electricity, but the electricity source may be more polluting than gas! But at least the consumer ""feels"" like it's less polluting."	jimmysong	254	36	1521304902	975049549365510146	https://twitter.com/jimmysong/status/975049549365510146			
	5/ What you lose with PoS is transparency (you know how people mined PoW, you don't with PoS) and security (there's no asymmetric problem that's hard to solve but easy to verify).	jimmysong	105	16	1521304812	975049172662538240	https://twitter.com/jimmysong/status/975049172662538240			
	4/ Ultimately, staking cost can be spent as creatively as people can think up and it will approach X. The economic cost (which may or may not include electricity), is still going to be similar to PoW.	jimmysong	95	12	1521304734	975048842562457600	https://twitter.com/jimmysong/status/975048842562457600			
	3/ They can also take out loans in the currency with the interest rate that still makes them profit for staking. They may even be willing to do evil things so they get to be a staker. For instance, DDoS other stakers.	jimmysong	92	11	1521304675	975048594700079105	https://twitter.com/jimmysong/status/975048594700079105			
	2/ What would people be willing to do? If there's any grinding they can do (manipulate previous transactions so they get stake reward), they will do it.	jimmysong	110	11	1521304603	975048293691650051	https://twitter.com/jimmysong/status/975048293691650051			
	Why POS doesn't make sense in a nutshell: 1/ Blocks produce X coins for some random staker. Economically, someone will pay up to X to become that staker.	jimmysong	528	177	1521304557	975048099277230080	https://twitter.com/jimmysong/status/975048099277230080
