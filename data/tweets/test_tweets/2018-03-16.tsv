bitcoin 	It’s important for Bitcoin to be forked to keep community honest so it’s always competing, but a fork does not increase the number of tokens, it creates a new competing chain.

	Decades later, some of the soldiers admitted what they did. Their only punishment was their conscience. Some of them are alive today, walking amongst us, enjoying the freedom and opportunity at happiness afforded every American. 5/5	Jose_Pagliery	15	7	1521163289	974455580386648064	https://twitter.com/Jose_Pagliery/status/974455580386648064			
	By any standard imaginable, there was never any justice. The GIs protected each other by keeping silent. Dozens of soldiers were criminally charged. Only Lt. William Calley Jr received punishment — a ridiculous 3 years in house arrest. These men killed 500 unarmed civilians.pic.twitter.com/NTeRXxhDv6	Jose_Pagliery	15	15	1521163107	974454814833770496	https://twitter.com/Jose_Pagliery/status/974454814833770496			
	The only American heroes that morning were in a tiny helicopter flying overhead. The pilot, Warrant Officer Hugh Thompson Jr, saw fellow GIs approaching a helpless crowd of Vietnamese people. He landed between them & ordered his 2-man crew to open fire if the killing didn’t stop.pic.twitter.com/E9a95CyZGP	Jose_Pagliery	68	24	1521162781	974453449826951169	https://twitter.com/Jose_Pagliery/status/974453449826951169			
	Following the sickening homicidal orders of their 24-year-old second lieutenant, the members of Charlie Company’s 1st Platoon began torturing everyone they saw.

	At this exact moment 50 years ago, a unit of US Army soldiers began to massacre the tiny Vietnamese village of My Lai.

	China is still probably at its highest level of financial stress in modern history and continuing to rise. Banks are the most stressed and credit likely to outpace nominal GDP in 2018 by even more than 2017. Does that mean a crisis is coming? No. Could it? Sure. 8/n	BaldingsWorld	11	2	1521189486	974565458203500544	https://twitter.com/BaldingsWorld/status/974565458203500544			
	You see a complex mixture, interaction, and collision of events. These variables are rough guides and that provide markers on risk accumulation.

	In almost every case, there is no ONE cause of an airplane crash (studies show this). Rather there are multiple factors that interact perfectly to cause an airplane crash.

	Eating a bacon cheese burger on your birthday with a milkshake? Not much of a problem.

	This is why we can look at metrics like the BIS credit gap or smokers and find false positives where we don't see the outcomes. Probability is not a guarantee in any conceivable way. What you typically find, though not always, is an accumulation of risk factors. 4/n	BaldingsWorld	8	0	1521188956	974563234714800128	https://twitter.com/BaldingsWorld/status/974563234714800128			
	BUT, it absolutely, positively, does not guarantee something will or won't happen. Just as we've all known grossly unhealthy people to live until 90 and vegans to die at 40, those baseline metrics do not determine what will happen in anyway. 3/n	BaldingsWorld	6	0	1521188672	974562045042425856	https://twitter.com/BaldingsWorld/status/974562045042425856

	Deterrence is not a mechanical or technological phenomenon. It is a psychological condition created by clear messaging, and communication of will. Capability is important, but we have scads of capability. We're lacking coherence and will. And money won't fix that. /6x	RadioFreeTom	88	19	1521227528	974725018922967040	https://twitter.com/RadioFreeTom/status/974725018922967040			
	People who want to make that argument need to show, you know, *evidence*. What's *really* hurting our deterrent is the passivity and inattention of a previous administration (Obama) and the utter incoherence and (where Russia is involved) craven fear of the current admin. /5	RadioFreeTom	27	5	1521227528	974725018037956608	https://twitter.com/RadioFreeTom/status/974725018037956608

	The idea that the Russians or anyone else are thinking our force is less capable because it's old is just idiotic. Did we really think we could attack the RU force after 1989 just because it was old and un-modernized? No. And no sane nuclear strategist thinks like that. /2	RadioFreeTom	57	11	1521227248	974723841745408000	https://twitter.com/RadioFreeTom/status/974723841745408000			
	A comment here on # nuclear modernization: it's a good thing to keep systems safe and modern.
