	That’s not accurate. I never predicted the END of branch banking. I predicted the decline of branch (50% decline between 2008-2025), and consolidation of sector as a result.

	How long will you loan money at X% to an organization that is increasingly unable to pay it back? At the margin, you will charge higher interest rates as the situation worsens. The 10Y ~2.8% rate is temporary... it will go to 3%, and 4%, and 5% in less than a decade.

	I see ICOs as a run around SV's cantankerous and expensive (in equity terms) traditional funding model, albeit with a lot of flaws. Perhaps there's a happier medium to be found.	el33th4xor	7	0	1522163136	978649240493846529	https://twitter.com/el33th4xor/status/978649240493846529			
	ICOs challenge the traditional VC model: true, ICO investors provide no key industry connections, guidance, know-how, PR/HR infra, etc, but also they take no equity, and they provide a large set of early adopters.	el33th4xor	9	0	1522163036	978648821663137792	https://twitter.com/el33th4xor/status/978648821663137792

	I don't get all the self-styled pundits first doing ICOs then bashing them.

	Good investing involves not letting emotions sway you. Volatility can be scary and no one likes to see their account swing by 2-3% a day. So don't look.

Now that crypto collapsed from >$800 bln to <$300 bln you only need a one billion dollar valuation to crack the crypto top 20. Once again, I see significant upside in some of those top names.

	The presumption that a human is mature enough to handle responsibility X at age Y is fundamentally flawed. The hypocrisy of setting the age limit at 21 is that the State has decreed that it's fine for folks to use them at 18 so long as it's to kill on behalf of the State.	lopp	19	4	1522178052	978711803579523073	https://twitter.com/lopp/status/978711803579523073

	That's my advice. Love, family, counseling, school, and activism close to home. Less shouting and fist-pumping, more learning and participating. /13x	RadioFreeTom	700	69	1522120030	978468444202061825	https://twitter.com/RadioFreeTom/status/978468444202061825			
	Do not let adults who will gladly take advantage of you put their bumper stickers and causes on you. You have a lot of time to figure out your politics. Give that process time. Don't just absorb them as you're swept along by others who may not have your interests at heart. /12	RadioFreeTom	431	48	1522120030	978468443371593728	https://twitter.com/RadioFreeTom/status/978468443371593728			
	And whatever you do, do not become the poster children - as some of you already are becoming - for issues that are being foisted on the back of this tragedy. You are not intersectional avatars fighting general oppression. You're kids who've experienced something hideous. /11	RadioFreeTom	412	43	1522120030	978468442054459392	https://twitter.com/RadioFreeTom/status/978468442054459392			
	You will learn something very important: change takes time, it takes drudgery, and it's boring. But when it pays off, it's lasting and it means something. What's happening right now will end and you will feel a crushing letdown. This is inevitable. Do something sustainable. /10	RadioFreeTom	461	62	1522120029	978468439730909184	https://twitter.com/RadioFreeTom/status/978468439730909184			
	To recap: Stay close to your parents or other relatives and friends. Get counseling. Get back in the classroom. Be an activist, at the local level, where you can do the most good, and then work with adults in your community to pressure the state and national government. /9	RadioFreeTom	413	42	1522120029	978468437814120448	https://twitter.com/RadioFreeTom/status/978468437814120448			
	And did I mention staying out of the glare of the national media? Here's a secret, kids: TV is not your friend. A few months from now, when this is over, you will be old news. Producers and anchors not your counselors. They feel for you, but they have jobs and other stories. /8	RadioFreeTom	454	53	1522120028	978468436547395585	https://twitter.com/RadioFreeTom/status/978468436547395585			
	But make sure that you do something else, like be teenagers. Finish high school. Go to a movie. Play games. Go to a prom. Do things your classmates who died cannot do now. Do not let the media and the short-term feel good of sudden celebrity steal what's left of high school. /7	RadioFreeTom	550	63	1522120028	978468435444273152	https://twitter.com/RadioFreeTom/status/978468435444273152			
	Hound your state reps and state senators for progress reports. Keep each other informed and hold regular meetings at school to know how much progress you're making at the local, state, county, and Federal level. /6	RadioFreeTom	312	32	1522120028	978468434626433024	https://twitter.com/RadioFreeTom/status/978468434626433024			
	Then demand answers -with your parents - from the sheriff. Find out who should be fired. Do all of this with your parents by your side as the people who pay their salaries. Meet with your members of Congress to ask them to call on the FBI to explain how Cruz slipped past them. /5	RadioFreeTom	376	35	1522120028	978468433653387264	https://twitter.com/RadioFreeTom/status/978468433653387264			
	Local activism works. Ask the adults in your community to reduce the number of guns in your town, near your school, in your county. Lead a drive for a gun turn-in. A short term and do-able thing; police depts have reported some successes with those drives. /4	RadioFreeTom	327	34	1522120028	978468432772567040	https://twitter.com/RadioFreeTom/status/978468432772567040			
	Later, sit down with the adults in your family, your school, and your city. Talk to them. Ask them what they intend to do. Ask them, for example, how Cruz got his guns and evaded being locked up for so long. Demand to know the points of failure that got your friends killed. /3	RadioFreeTom	443	49	1522120027	978468431526842368	https://twitter.com/RadioFreeTom/status/978468431526842368			
	Next, take time to grieve and to process what happened. That does not happen in green rooms and in big rallies. That's just giving in to the Instant Celebrity Culture (see: David Hogg) and getting hooked on jolts of publicity at an age too young to understand how bad that is. /2	RadioFreeTom	522	67	1522120027	978468430495043584	https://twitter.com/RadioFreeTom/status/978468430495043584

	"There is nothing to do with ""this moment."" No one is changing their minds here. Vote. Vote. Vote. I also think it's important to stigmatize the gun culture. (Not guns, the culture.)

	I work on a military base. If you think we don't have stuff like that, you're just stupid.

	It's not a binary choice. It's just another example of the way Americans only get motivated by a problem facing kids if there's a huge media circus aspect to it.
