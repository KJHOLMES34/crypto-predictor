	Great point, you are offloading trust to the VPN operator in hope that they're collecting less logs than the ISP you are using by default.

	Another reason I worry abt monolithic VMs. I want separate, community chains and smart contracts, with localized consensus.

	Yep. If reputation becomes algorithmically defined along a single spectrum, we'll create a Black Mirror society. Reputation can be extremely valuable, but the key is for it to be valued differently in different settings, and with very strong privacy in place. 1/	mikejcasey	1	0	1521558428	976112914758238208	https://twitter.com/mikejcasey/status/976112914758238208			
	Yes. No guarantee our blockchain data can't be exploited. We'll still create traceable network graphs. Design principles are key. Encryption solutions lie in zkSnarks, homomorphic encryption etc. But also must think hard abt on-chain data vs off-chain. And who do we really trust?	mikejcasey	0	0	1521557054	976107149041512449	https://twitter.com/mikejcasey/status/976107149041512449			
	This is Chinese citizens' version of what we face with Facebook. One is state-managed personal data, the other corporate. I suppose I prefer the latter, but it reflects the same structural problem of a centralized the economy around our data.https://www.theverge.com/2018/3/16/17130366/china-social-credit-travel-plane-train-tickets?utm_campaign=theverge&utm_content=entry&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter …	mikejcasey	39	16	1521555629	976101173613809665	https://twitter.com/mikejcasey/status/976101173613809665

	They all get back to data. Data isn't just the oil of our age. It's the currency. (What do you think we've been paying Facebook with?) Can't have retirement/won't stop volatility until we figure out how to properly apportion value transfers for this most important of resources.	mikejcasey	1	1	1521551365	976083287419572224	https://twitter.com/mikejcasey/status/976083287419572224			
	You can't fix the structure without decentralizing it. That means replacing the entire business model of centralized platform advertising with a completely new bargain with users. Here's one way FB might do it - https://www.coindesk.com/facebook-blockchain-token-might-look-like/ … - are shareholders are ready for it?	mikejcasey	3	0	1521551105	976082198209155073	https://twitter.com/mikejcasey/status/976082198209155073

	Yeah. I think it's going mainstream. The EU introduced sweeping privacy laws because of this problem. In the US people are less incensed but they're getting so. NSA, Equifax, OPM etc. Breach after breach.

	Not a time for moral umbrage. Whether Zuck's the devil or not isn't the point! It's a structural problem. Blns of vulnerable access points to centralized data honeypots, and misaligned incentives for those in charge of them. The Internet has a design flaw.

	That it wasn't a breach is the most damning thing of all. The matter at stake is not the quality of a company's firewalls - although that's how many tend to think of their IT security - it's that the very existence of centralized data honeypots is now a huge societal problem.	mikejcasey	3	0	1521517240	975940158393671680	https://twitter.com/mikejcasey/status/975940158393671680

	Whatever the solutions, they need to be able to almost automatically create network advantages, much as Facebook did in taking out MySpace. And it need not (in fact better not) be a single platform.

	GREEの子供向けVRゲーム、品川シーサイドでは1回5分弱で200円。お母さん達は「これ位の時間遊ばせてくれるなら良い」と。視力も「家にあってずっとやるのとは違う」と好意的。むしろ「私もやったことないのでどう見えてるか気になる。一緒にやってみたい」という声が。衛生面も抵抗ないみたいです。pic.twitter.com/hHn7tQU2d4	mochi_wsj	47	39	1521512907	975921985539555328	https://twitter.com/mochi_wsj/status/975921985539555328

	I'm never looking for a pump so I don't care if it moves 10% right now. The big move to all time high can't be pumped. Once you understand this you'll do much better in this space. Ask around.

	If it moves up 10%, wait for the retracement. If a coin pumps after a chart it will ALWAYS drop back down. You should know this... 2 months ago it was a 250 million mkt cap coin - traded it then too.

	Good time to bring this one up again. As coins begin moving or if you see a coin pumping after a chart is posted in telegram or on Twitter -> MOVE SLOW. You can often times still buy at the ideal support after retracement.https://twitter.com/VentureCoinist/status/964373979032006656 …	VentureCoinist	57	12	1521584264	976221276212613120	https://twitter.com/VentureCoinist/status/976221276212613120
