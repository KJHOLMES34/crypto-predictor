	"Which is not to say that the Gnostics were right, but that they came from a hyper-scholasticism that believed it could find divine revelation. This is more pedestrian: ""Other humans are hiding knowledge from us, and only I'm smart enough to know it."" So, very different."

	It's a good question. I'd say no, because the Gnostics were people who were convinced that learning and deep study could reveal truths. This is different: this is a paranoid's version of self-empowerment. It begins from a narcissistic assumption that everyone is stupid but you.
