	If that's Ark's vision, then that's great. But there are projects that are proudly DPoS forever.	VitalikButerin	30	9	1519983340	969506513415843840	https://twitter.com/VitalikButerin/status/969506513415843840			
	Note that I predict many DPOS systems will seem to avoid this equilibrium for a long time, because a large portion of their coins will be the premine held by the founders and the foundation.

	Fundamentally, all DPOS systems as far as I can tell basically succumb to the explicit bribing attack. These pools give up to 90% of their staking revenues out to anyone who votes for them; this game inherently favors larger and larger pools	VitalikButerin	50	15	1519959736	969407514470002688	https://twitter.com/VitalikButerin/status/969407514470002688

	Dear @ jack happy to meet with you and go over ways to improve twitter. First. Require real names in profiles and authenticate that it’s a real user. Create accountability. Second.

	Not sure why you think this. V is a measure of how much the money supply circulates in a given timeframe (not transaction value).

	From last Sunday. And we did go lower as thought and spx did get destroyed as expected but huge huge warning. Crash channels have violent backtest and may happen next week.
