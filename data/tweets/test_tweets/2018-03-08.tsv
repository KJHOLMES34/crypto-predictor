	My point is that freedom of association means that any party to an economic transaction may use any arbitrary reason to decide that they do not wish to engage in said transaction. So, to answer your question: yes.	lopp	3	0	1520526518	971784768764502016	https://twitter.com/lopp/status/971784768764502016			
	It's not equivalence so much as irrelevance. The good/service being sold is irrelevant. The attributes used by the parties to determine if they wish to voluntarily engage in an economic transaction are similarly irrelevant.

	For instance, if GDP deflator is 5% and PPI is 3% & CPI is 1%. It is a little surprising how common CPI and PPI cannot mathematically be weighted to arrive at GDP deflator. This implies deflator being manipulated to hit specific target, in this case, real GDP. The more you know.	BaldingsWorld	11	3	1520490741	971634709129146368	https://twitter.com/BaldingsWorld/status/971634709129146368			
	However, look at the yellow line of the implied PPI weight. There are some years where it is 100 and some years where it is zero. This means that CPI and PPI cannot mathematically be weighted to make the GDP deflator, though one is closer than the other. 3/n	BaldingsWorld	3	1	1520490623	971634216600391680	https://twitter.com/BaldingsWorld/status/971634216600391680			
	This means that the GDP deflator should be a relatively stable but ever evolving split between CPI and PPI indexes. Take a simple example. Assume a 50/50 split in activity with CPI up 10% and PPI flat at 0. GDP deflator is 5%. With me so far? 2/n	BaldingsWorld	2	1	1520490533	971633838844596224	https://twitter.com/BaldingsWorld/status/971633838844596224			
	Something I always tell people, which they frequently don't understand, is that Chinese data does not reconcile to itself. Look at the GDP deflator, CPI, and PPI data here. Theoretically, this should cover an enormous share of all prices recorded in economic activity. 1/npic.twitter.com/9qsw7wcXdD	BaldingsWorld	24	5	1520490434	971633422010523648	https://twitter.com/BaldingsWorld/status/971633422010523648
