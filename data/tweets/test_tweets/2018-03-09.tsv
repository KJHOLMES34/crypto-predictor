	Here are instructions for adding ERC20 tokens: https://blog.edgesecure.co/how-to-add-erc20-tokens-to-edge-4c4951c3a8cc?source=linkShare-c4107ebb5102-1520554822 …	haydentiff	0	0	1520554853	971903614926163968	https://twitter.com/haydentiff/status/971903614926163968			
	Yes. In order to send ERC20 tokens, ETH is needed. (you can receive them without it, though.)	haydentiff	1	0	1520554454	971901941654663168	https://twitter.com/haydentiff/status/971901941654663168

	They’re working on something back there that really seems to tire them out and requires a lot of breaks. I don’t think it’s catering as food on their menu seems to be a real struggle.

	I don’t think they bring in a lot of cash. The place is usually empty, except for the 20 workers hiding in the back, doing who knows what and needing constant cigarette breaks.	haydentiff	0	0	1520551196	971888274506645504	https://twitter.com/haydentiff/status/971888274506645504

	They don’t often have customers but they’ve got a bunch of workers doing *something* in the back.

	Have you ever been in a restaurant that you swore had to be a front for something else? There’s a restaurant near me that when I’m there, I feel like I’m the only one in the place whose ever been to a restaurant before.

	The tax rules, specifically, are insane. The root problem is that the IRS treats all crypto the same. Drawing a distinction between currencies (eg BTC, BCH, ETH etc) vs securities vs collectibles (eg cryptokitties) would probably be the wisest and most coherent thing to do.	el33th4xor	55	6	1520559875	971924678666309638	https://twitter.com/el33th4xor/status/971924678666309638

bitcoin 	It's clear that Bitcoin dominates the market, but I suspect that that is because of its superior mindshare and brand recognition, not its SoV.

	If I was to pick a network that looks like TCP/IP for Internet native value transfer, that would be the Lightening Network. It joins together multiple blockchains so they can communicate on one standard, just like TCP/IP does. And no, there's no Lightning Network token. /5	woonomic	103	25	1520570509	971969282161631236	https://twitter.com/woonomic/status/971969282161631236			
	And we know programming environments fall into and out of favour, they have specialist use cases, and generally more are created as needs change. The programming environments are not TCP/IP. And no, you can't buy a token in a programming environment. /4	woonomic	13	3	1520570509	971969279762444289	https://twitter.com/woonomic/status/971969279762444289			
	The token is simply access to the transport layer below, it has no network effects (apart from liquidity). The programming environment above the network (e.g. Solidity) has lock-in but is also transportable to other blockchains offering more throughput / lower fees. /3	woonomic	14	5	1520570508	971969277212291073	https://twitter.com/woonomic/status/971969277212291073			
ethereum 	You can look at blockchain protocols as specialised environments with relatively weak network effects. Example: Ethereum's EVM environment upon which most of today's smart contracts are built on is also available on ETC RSK and XCP. /2	woonomic	16	4	1520570508	971969274578219009	https://twitter.com/woonomic/status/971969274578219009			
	A lot of investors are coming in on this widely held wisdom that investing in blockchain protocols are like buying real estate in TCP/IP and collecting rent.

	To all the Trump fans asking me: no, I don't think Trump holding a meeting with Kim Jong-un is, in itself, a big accomplishment, or proof that his strategy on North Korea is working.

	So be patient. Our best work is done one day at a time. It is dreary, but it is a proven method. If your efforts are successful, the tedium of human days will no longer matter to you - or him - and he will be yours for eternity. Your affectionate Uncle, Screwtape	RadioFreeTom	133	11	1520634546	972237871158579201	https://twitter.com/RadioFreeTom/status/972237871158579201			
	But do not lose your concentration here. If Shame turns to Repentance, your work will collapse before your eyes. The Enemy will be directly available to the patient, and He will likely foreclose your efforts for a time. It is unfair, but that is the nature of war. /14	RadioFreeTom	72	6	1520634546	972237870089035777	https://twitter.com/RadioFreeTom/status/972237870089035777			
	Now comes the best part. By getting him to defend this vices as a matter of Pride, you have cleared a great obstacle to your later temptations. Avarice, cruelty, sexual excess - once your man has defended these, it is a much shorter step to get him to engage in them. /13	RadioFreeTom	69	7	1520634545	972237868939784192	https://twitter.com/RadioFreeTom/status/972237868939784192			
	Remember, your patient has been taught that Shame itself undermines his human autonomy. You must reinforce this thought at every turn. By the time you’re done with him, he will positively defend murder if that’s what it takes to avert the raw scream of Shame. /12	RadioFreeTom	68	6	1520634545	972237868033863686	https://twitter.com/RadioFreeTom/status/972237868033863686			
	Indeed, the emotion of shame is usually of more use to the Enemy than to us. Thus, you must do all in your power to smother it, even when it is only a tiny flicker. You have one advantage in the terrain here: you can bring his Pride to bear at such moments. /11	RadioFreeTom	63	6	1520634545	972237866540683265	https://twitter.com/RadioFreeTom/status/972237866540683265			
	You must, at all costs, prevent this feeling from turning into full-blown Shame. Now, you may wonder at this. Shame is a form of misery, and delightful in the anguish it produces. But beware, Wormwood: shame is also a precursor to repentance, and thus can be quite dangerous. /10	RadioFreeTom	69	8	1520634545	972237865609584641	https://twitter.com/RadioFreeTom/status/972237865609584641			
	Now comes the hard part. Your patient right now has a rather queasy feeling about all this. He knows that he is being dishonest defending evil practices that he himself abhors, merely because his loyalty to the Old Man demands it. /9	RadioFreeTom	59	6	1520634544	972237864699351040	https://twitter.com/RadioFreeTom/status/972237864699351040			
	Not only can you instill him a solid habit of lying to himself and to others, but you can, with very little prodding, teach him that lying is a positive virtue. This might seem incredible to you, but you must grasp how hard it is for them to live without such rationalizations. /8	RadioFreeTom	68	8	1520634544	972237863457837057	https://twitter.com/RadioFreeTom/status/972237863457837057			
	He is learning (or, I should hope you are teaching him) to contradict himself because he believes it is for the public good.

	Instead, your young man is an idiot who believes he can hold multiple contradictory views at the same time. Even better, your patient’s pride -- that most beautiful of all the vices -- is already at work in him. /6	RadioFreeTom	75	7	1520634544	972237861461295107	https://twitter.com/RadioFreeTom/status/972237861461295107			
	But these are decisions for the High Command, not for us. More to the point is that your patient has no real ability to follow a logical argument. Thanks to Our Father Below, these skills are no longer taught to humans, nor do they value such abilities. /5	RadioFreeTom	76	9	1520634543	972237860551217152	https://twitter.com/RadioFreeTom/status/972237860551217152			
	This is not to say that there are not evil political positions. You are too young to remember the abolition of slavery, but it was a major blow to our cause. We have steadily been reintroducing this practice with greater care, but we will never replicate our earlier successes. /4	RadioFreeTom	73	6	1520634543	972237859645206529	https://twitter.com/RadioFreeTom/status/972237859645206529

	As I mentioned last time, politics has no real value to us. A repentant fascist who seeks redemption is far worse for us than a humanitarian freighted with sins and who remains closed to the Enemy even as he professes his love for his fellow man. /2	RadioFreeTom	81	6	1520634543	972237857355071488	https://twitter.com/RadioFreeTom/status/972237857355071488			
	My dear Wormwood, You are correct: by getting your man to betray his conscience even on trivial matters, you are setting him for far better sins. With patience, the vice of Hypocrisy can be the foundation for much more reliable habits of damnation. This is worth examination. /1	RadioFreeTom	445	142	1520634542	972237855903899648	https://twitter.com/RadioFreeTom/status/972237855903899648

	Yes rates up are very very destructive and causes money to move to safety driving rates down.

	The fact rates have not broke up and has had every possible chance too. Means the next move may be up. Would not shock me to see 3.% now then 2.5% quickly after.
