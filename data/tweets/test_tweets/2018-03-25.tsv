ripple 	I was confused by RippleNet, as I was stilling referring to the XRP Ledger as the Ripple Network, which it used to be called. Ripple used to be Ripple Labs used to be OpenCoin. XRP used to be called “ripples” and apparently don’t actually have a name, only a currency code.	haydentiff	6	0	1521998401	977958292306702336	https://twitter.com/haydentiff/status/977958292306702336

ripple 	I’m not of the opinion that how other people spend their crypto is any of my business. That said, Ripple has been very open & transparent about their XRP holdings, going so far as put them in escrow to help ease investor concerns.https://ripple.com/xrp/market-performance/ …	haydentiff	18	4	1521997674	977955245195190272	https://twitter.com/haydentiff/status/977955245195190272			
ripple 	All crypto is created by code. Some code is designed to make people jump through hoops to obtain it and some code generates the crypto immediately. Ripple Consensus prevents double spending.https://code.likeagirl.io/xrp-is-a-cryptocurrency-like-the-uss-zumwalt-is-a-boat-3b25be5226b8?source=linkShare-c4107ebb5102-1521996267 …	haydentiff	61	27	1521996464	977950169533698053	https://twitter.com/haydentiff/status/977950169533698053

ripple 	I’m not a fan of Rippleco’s branding either but they didn’t do it to be malicious. There was no mining involved in the creation of $ XRP, so calling it “premined” adds to the confusion.

	1. Nitpicky to ask that every sentence use conditional tense for an active adversary, when that's the well doc'd adversary model. 2. LN requires a malleability fix.
