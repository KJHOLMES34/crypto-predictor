	Second statistic I'd like to know: do college dropouts generally have lower GPAs than college students who finish, or not? If yes, then this also explains (part of) the evidence.	VitalikButerin	3	4	1521042690	973949750075711490	https://twitter.com/VitalikButerin/status/973949750075711490			
	Or do I not know enough about the real world and post-college employers *do* ask for GPAs? Do you happen to know this?	VitalikButerin	4	4	1521042594	973949350048141312	https://twitter.com/VitalikButerin/status/973949350048141312			
	So here's an interesting puzzle: * Employers in post-college contexts generally don't ask for GPAs * Co-op employers (ie. tech companies who hire students during off terms) at the university I went to do, or at least students volunteer the info, and it heavily impacts salary	VitalikButerin	4	4	1521042540	973949123572400129	https://twitter.com/VitalikButerin/status/973949123572400129			
	Possible ideas: 1. Plain old intra-organizational inefficiency. It's much more complicated to ask for and evaluate complete academic transcripts than just a degree. 2. Partial completion is specifically an anti-signal that college didn't work well at giving you personally HC.

	Graduation year gives you the diploma, which is employer's only (easy) way of determining ability. It's the same story as the signaling story, but with the key difference that the ability the diploma signals is ability *created* by college, not ability *proven* by college.

	"This *does not* explain the ""education benefits individuals much more than countries"" evidence, but even still it does explain some of the other evidence, suggesting that dominant sheepskin effect by itself does not imply low HC gain - only low *observable* HC gain."

	@ bryan_caplan so I think I've found a hypothetical pro-human-capital story that fits the sheepskin effect: * Education really does improve HC * However, HC improvement from education is unobservable for a long time * Diplomas step in to signal that this HC improvement exists	VitalikButerin	63	12	1521021684	973861644026728449	https://twitter.com/VitalikButerin/status/973861644026728449			@

	I can agree RE: full nodes having power over fundamental protocol changes. I think selling the narrative to full node operators that they somehow have more impact on the security or resiliency of the distributed ledger is irresponsible though.	ummjackson	2	0	1521044997	973959427924488192	https://twitter.com/ummjackson/status/973959427924488192			
	I'd also argue that from a resiliency perspective, wiping out 50% of the global mining power would be far more detrimental to the security of the network than wiping out 50% of full nodes.	ummjackson	5	0	1521044476	973957242230792192	https://twitter.com/ummjackson/status/973957242230792192			
	I get the point you're making, but I tend to disagree that this somehow puts miners on an even keel to regular full nodes. Miners can prioritize and censor which transactions make it into the next block.

	I didn’t mean to suggest they’ll only go after pure frauds.

	I think the SEC should do an ICO to solve their funding shortfall for policing ICOs, it would also help them understand the problem. Everything good in the world is recursive.	woonomic	509	107	1520989176	973725298444328960	https://twitter.com/woonomic/status/973725298444328960

	NVT Ratio is laggy. But reliable in the dead cat phase. It's also a good indicator into what part of the price cycle we are in. The other version of NVT... NVT Signal is quite responsive, it's not laggy and good for timing tops and bottoms for traders.	woonomic	9	0	1520985464	973709729305280512	https://twitter.com/woonomic/status/973709729305280512			
	NVT tracks value throughput on the blockchain, whether you batch transactions, or use Segwit, it doesn't make any difference. Layer 2 scaling like LN however will take transactions off the chain so will reduce NVT's accuracy, unless we can get LN throughput data somehow.	woonomic	19	2	1520985276	973708939714965504	https://twitter.com/woonomic/status/973708939714965504			
	NVT Signal is a skewed NVT geared towards responsiveness. It's responsive enough to call tops and bottoms, not for a read of where we are in the cycle. You can also see NVT Signal was also mid-range in the 2014 dead cat.	woonomic	12	0	1520985134	973708344908115968	https://twitter.com/woonomic/status/973708344908115968

	They charge a 40 sat/byte transaction, even though 1-2 sat txs clear just fine. Network Cost for BCash is 0% because no one uses it (always empty blocks) and it's worth a lot less.
