	With PoW, a majority of miners can rewrite history. Not possible with XRP. With BTC you *can’t* fork and get the rules you want (or even evolve the rules) unless you’re confident you can incentivize enough PoW to keep your chain secure.

	Because there are so few wallets that support Segwit, I take advantage of Edge’s option to create non-Segwit wallets. Miners are forced stakeholders against user interests.

	I've no special knowledge on plans to make this happen. It's pure spec. But as far as I can tell, the technology more or less exists. It wouldn't need a permissionless blockchain.

	If that happens, why does either party -- business or CB -- need to denominate their contract in dollars? And if the dollar is not longer the currency of world trade, why would CBs need to hold it as a reserve asset to hedge against adverse exchange rate movements? 5/	mikejcasey	1	0	1521688303	976657648224481280	https://twitter.com/mikejcasey/status/976657648224481280			
	Now if the two CBs didn't want commercial entities using such tools, they themselves could act as agents of these businesses, conducting the transaction with each other.

	Neither party now has control of the contract, which will be executed once the goods are delivered - RFID-proven etc -- or reverted if not delivered within stipulated time frame.

	It depends; you can use BitGo in several configurations. I'd say that Casa is closest to setting up a BitGo wallet where you generate the third key offline and hold it yourself. Casa enables a bit more redundancy by having the user hold 4 keys; can lose 2 keys and still recover.	lopp	2	0	1521738684	976868960565153792	https://twitter.com/lopp/status/976868960565153792
