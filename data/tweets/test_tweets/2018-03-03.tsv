	Not really. You’re allowed to say whatever you want. But you are liable for consequences. That’s how all speech works. If X orders Y to murder Z, X is liable for the murder as well as Y.

	$ BTC did not go from $20,000 to $6,000 because of a chart pattern ... it dropped 70% because of all the bad headlines that came out between those two price points. Do not fool yourself.

	Technical Analysts crack me up ... they do not like $ BTC when is it at ~$8,800 on the way down ... but they like it at ~$11,300 when it is on the way up?

	Essentially what happens when you trade is that you import productivity gains. And yes, just like any form of productive economic competition, it creates short-term losers as well as winners. Just like any form of productive economic competition.	prchovanec	20	5	1520111895	970045715392155648	https://twitter.com/prchovanec/status/970045715392155648			
	And that has nothing to do with running a trade surplus or deficit. The dislocative effects of trade - like any form of productive economic competition, I might add - exist quite apart from the net export/import balance.	prchovanec	4	0	1520111797	970045303989637121	https://twitter.com/prchovanec/status/970045303989637121
