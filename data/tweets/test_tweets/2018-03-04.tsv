	A vanity is therefore a good way to stop impersonators. When my website got cloned, they caught the address change, because of the vanity. Easy even for newbies. There are no bech32 vanity address generators I can use at scale (weeks of computation) to get that security.	aantonop	40	2	1520202690	970426537672458245	https://twitter.com/aantonop/status/970426537672458245			
	My Twitter, website and reddit account have all been impersonated. My website got cloned in its entirety.

	For the record, BCH didn't exist when I published the second edition (June 2017). BCH is relevant and will be included in the third edition. Instead of writing a hyperbolic hit-piece against me, BCH advocates could contribute a factual, technical and well written PR to the book.	aantonop	193	23	1520189280	970370289358946304	https://twitter.com/aantonop/status/970370289358946304

	Thanks! Well, the code itself doesn't become decentralized - everyone in the P2P network is just running the same (or similar) code with the same consensus rules. That's why networking is so important, because all those nodes need to be reliably communicating with each other.	ummjackson	0	0	1520184561	970350497411473408	https://twitter.com/ummjackson/status/970350497411473408			
	"Some background in network engineering can help a lot... the ""crypto"" part of these protocols is just one part of the equation.

	4/ That being said, I'm always up for being a sounding board for anyone just getting into the space and building cool new technology... that's my passion and I want everyone who shares it to have the best chance of succeeding.

	Chances of NEO NOT being broken right now: 0% It takes time to build and test a BFT protocol, as should be evident from the thread. Takes time to go from a synchronous network assumption to an asynchronous network. There's no way that happened in a few days. Caveat investor.	el33th4xor	110	27	1520186317	970357860671639552	https://twitter.com/el33th4xor/status/970357860671639552			
	Byzantine behaviors, message reorderings, quorum membership changes, these are hard to test. A simple 1-node failure is trivial to test. There's no excuse for a broken system as a result of a single fail-stop failure.	el33th4xor	57	3	1520183997	970348131064872960	https://twitter.com/el33th4xor/status/970348131064872960			
	While anyone can make a mistake in an implementation, this one is far too elementary and points to a broken design and development process at NEO.	el33th4xor	41	5	1520183860	970347556411793408	https://twitter.com/el33th4xor/status/970347556411793408			
	Replication of this kind is employed to improve liveness. The system can remain up even if a hardware failure takes out a server. But in this case, it actually hampered liveness. The system died because just one server failed.	el33th4xor	23	2	1520183690	970346842897645569	https://twitter.com/el33th4xor/status/970346842897645569			
	If you have 7 nodes, all running exactly the same code, under the same administrator, you don't have any fault tolerance. Anyone who can compromise one can compromise all. Might as well use a single beefy server.	el33th4xor	64	8	1520183503	970346060471259137	https://twitter.com/el33th4xor/status/970346060471259137

	Hilarious. #6 cryptocurrency NEO is just a 7-node system Uber the control of a single party, and the code isn't designed to handle even a single, benign failure.https://twitter.com/ercwl/status/970294228122263552 …	el33th4xor	447	132	1520180061	970331623236435968	https://twitter.com/el33th4xor/status/970331623236435968		#6

	10/ Indeed, MAST is a rare example of a win-win-win in terms of efficiency, privacy and functionality.pic.twitter.com/SPEOu21t2n	CremeDeLaCrypto	17	2	1520198166	970407561106153472	https://twitter.com/CremeDeLaCrypto/status/970407561106153472			
bitcoin 	9/ David Harding ( @ hrdng) said it best: “So the real achievement of MAST is not that it allows Bitcoin users to create more advanced smart contracts than before, but that it does so without placing any new worst-case burdens on Bitcoin nodes.”	CremeDeLaCrypto	12	1	1520198151	970407496685797376	https://twitter.com/CremeDeLaCrypto/status/970407496685797376			@
	8/ It also improves functionality in that with MAST we can add more subscripts for more complex smart contracts while avoiding bumping up against byte size hard limits.	CremeDeLaCrypto	9	0	1520198139	970407446127681536	https://twitter.com/CremeDeLaCrypto/status/970407446127681536			
	7/ MAST also improves privacy in that we minimize the scope of a contract that must be published publicly on-chain for anyone to see. As a result, a greater portion of the smart contact’s terms remain private to its participants.	CremeDeLaCrypto	10	0	1520198125	970407389168979968	https://twitter.com/CremeDeLaCrypto/status/970407389168979968

	5/ This improves efficiency in that we avoid burdening the network with irrelevant portions of the smart contract—this helps minimize data processing and storage requirements for network participants (e.g. full nodes).

	4/ In any given smart contract it’s likely that only a portion may be relevant to a particular tx and, with MAST, we can reduce what’s published on-chain to only the portion of the contract that is relevant to the tx being broadcast.	CremeDeLaCrypto	10	0	1520198065	970407139045863427	https://twitter.com/CremeDeLaCrypto/status/970407139045863427

	2/ As with prior posts on Schnorr Sigs (http://bit.ly/2I1MaIM ) and Scriptless Scripts (http://bit.ly/2FbNw5S ), MAST’s efficiency, privacy, and functionality advantages are obtained primarily by minimizing on-chain data processing and storage demands	CremeDeLaCrypto	14	3	1520198033	970407003787964416	https://twitter.com/CremeDeLaCrypto/status/970407003787964416

	That’s why a larger US budget deficit translates into a larger trade deficit, all other things being equal.	prchovanec	1	0	1520180343	970332804742598661	https://twitter.com/prchovanec/status/970332804742598661			
	Well first of all, by savings I mean national savings, which includes both private and public savings (or in the case of public borrowing, dissavings)	prchovanec	1	0	1520180301	970332630167310338	https://twitter.com/prchovanec/status/970332630167310338			
	Okay. Happy to talk more about it anytime. Let me recommend this article where I discuss the basic concept:http://foreignpolicy.com/2015/02/20/its-time-to-kick-germany-out-of-the-eurozone/ …	prchovanec	0	0	1520180205	970332227321171975	https://twitter.com/prchovanec/status/970332227321171975			
	Countries like China or Germany run trade surpluses because they have an excess of savings which goes to finance other countries’ trade deficits.	prchovanec	1	0	1520180118	970331863456862209	https://twitter.com/prchovanec/status/970331863456862209			
	I’m holding a lot of things constant here (like foreign reserve balances, and the difference between current account and trade balance) to simplify. But basically, that’s it.	prchovanec	1	0	1520180065	970331641158782976	https://twitter.com/prchovanec/status/970331641158782976			
	It’s the opposite: we save less than we invest, and the difference must be made up by capital inflows; that corespondents to a trade deficit.	prchovanec	1	0	1520180010	970331409494798336	https://twitter.com/prchovanec/status/970331409494798336			
	That, by the way, gives he lie to Ross’ argument that this is just a little itty bitty tariff so what’s the big deal? It’s an opening salvo in a wholesale reversal of 70 years of bipartisan US statescraft, and they know it.	prchovanec	286	133	1520179878	970330856656113666	https://twitter.com/prchovanec/status/970330856656113666			
	Well, at least they’re being honest: they oppose the post-WW2 liberal economic order crafted by the US, and seek to unravel it.

	It’s a price shock on a key input at a time everyone’s skittish about inflation. Then add the harm from retaliation. Then add anxiety over Trump’s scary “trade wars are good” attitude.

	And yes, I agree we need to get tough on those practices. But the best way to do this isn’t by trying to beat them at their own destructive game, but leading the way and asking China if it wants to join or be left out.	prchovanec	0	0	1520178849	970326537869373440	https://twitter.com/prchovanec/status/970326537869373440

	Religion and belief was not just an obstacle to the State, but to the progress of history itself, and those who practiced it had to be destroyed. This is Marxism-Leninism 101. Stalin was no different from the men who seized power with him. Same for Mao, for Pol Pot.

	Atheism was integral to control of the state, but more than that, he was steeped - and we know this from what he read and wrote about - in Marxism, and believed in it.
