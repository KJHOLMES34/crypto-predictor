ethereum 	Yep, alt_bn128, just like Zcash (pre-Sapling). Here's the code implementing the precompiles: https://github.com/ethereum/pyethereum/blob/develop/ethereum/specials.py#L140 …	VitalikButerin	2	1	1530045144	1011708778624905216	https://twitter.com/VitalikButerin/status/1011708778624905216		#L140		-0.08	0.2859	0
ethereum 	Since when is Zcash a rival? I see the Zcash community as one of the ethereum community's closest allies.	VitalikButerin	23	2	1530044811	1011707383523885057	https://twitter.com/VitalikButerin/status/1011707383523885057				0.00	0.0	0
bitcoin ethereum 	Now, notice I'm not saying that Zcash does not or should not have *any* monetary policy commitments in its social contract. As far as I can tell, Zooko is trying to take a balanced approach, more conservative than ethereum at present, less conservative than bitcoin at present.

	"> Zooko's inconsistencies I see none so far > Relationships between privacy, property and monetary policy Addressed this elsewhere. IMO it's fundamentally reasonable to have a cryptocurrency that sees monetary policy as ""not fundamental""."

	I think mature cryptorrencies should in general be very careful about making changes that hurt some constituencies to benefit others. But beyond that I don't see monetary policy as being more central than, say, PoW vs PoS, unless it is stated otherwise in the social contract.	VitalikButerin	2	3	1530037241	1011675631598256128	https://twitter.com/VitalikButerin/status/1011675631598256128				0.07	0.2547	0

	Oh sure, but I don't really see monetary policy being along that axis. Especially monetary policy of voluntary cryptocurrencies.	VitalikButerin	0	1	1530035186	1011667013691834368	https://twitter.com/VitalikButerin/status/1011667013691834368				0.05	0.0828	0
