	thanks neeraj, but I approach crypto as a new means to organize & incentivize human activity without needing to extract profits from the commons that are created (UTs only one way to do so). that's where my thinking diverges from pomp's focus on tokenizing existing asset classes	cburniske	36	3	1529243587	1008346808517562370	https://twitter.com/cburniske/status/1008346808517562370				0.28	0.5843	0

ethereum 	If an ERC20 has not been keeping the backup of all their transactions on their own internal database or had an Ethereum Node (might be impossible) they will lose all history of their decentralized contracts.

bitcoin ethereum 	No it does not... because Ethereum actually is a Ponzi, Bitcoin is not. I think only ignorant people do not see that and they are blinded by the price increase, just like in a traditional ponzi.
