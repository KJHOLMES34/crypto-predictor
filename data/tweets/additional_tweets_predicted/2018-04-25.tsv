bitcoin 	Saying Bitcoin can be bigger than the impact of the internet is absurd...

bitcoin 	Really looking forward to seeing a lot of internet/Bitcoin/trading friends again at Consensus this year and of course to do our first live show with @ magicalcrypto. Just too bad it's in NY, travelling to the US isn't fun (as a foreigner).https://twitter.com/fluffypony/status/988814935613431810 …	WhalePanda	83	4	1524643599	989053056770887680	https://twitter.com/WhalePanda/status/989053056770887680			@	-0.02	-0.0862	0
	6/ Refusing to recognize the power of the law, and refusing to recognize the power of # crypto, are both dead ends. As with most things in life, the truth is somewhere in-between.	cburniske	56	11	1524681159	989210595395342336	https://twitter.com/cburniske/status/989210595395342336		#		0.12	-0.2738	0
	5/ As I've said before, the # crypto community needs to find ways to openly & transparently collaborate with the regulators, as much as that may grate many libertarian roots:https://twitter.com/cburniske/status/978984450083127296 …	cburniske	31	4	1524681035	989210075775537153	https://twitter.com/cburniske/status/989210075775537153		#		0.13	0.2263	0
	4/ In the cases where it appears # crypto would have to contort itself to meet outdated laws in a way that is net negative for society, then it is less the technology that needs to change and more the law.	cburniske	28	6	1524680836	989209242946146305	https://twitter.com/cburniske/status/989209242946146305		#		0.17	-0.5719	0
	3/ A future challenge is how do we in # crypto work with regulators, applying existing laws where applicable & fair for society, without bending the technology over backwards to meet outdated laws.	cburniske	30	3	1524680691	989208635611013120	https://twitter.com/cburniske/status/989208635611013120		#		0.18	0.3818	0
	2/ The regulators, then, have already accomplished one big goal of signaling to the # crypto-community that rules & regulations cannot be an afterthought, but part of the planning process.	cburniske	45	5	1524680502	989207842052825090	https://twitter.com/cburniske/status/989207842052825090		#		0.13	0.2382	0
	1/ Nearly every new # crypto team I encounter is now explicitly talking about the SEC, CFTC, etc and how to handle regulation. If they're not, it's because the team is avoiding the US altogether.	cburniske	183	49	1524680343	989207172914536448	https://twitter.com/cburniske/status/989207172914536448		#		0.29	-0.17	0
	There’s always been a lot of confident people in crypto. Question is whether that confidence is market driven or conviction/fundamentals driven. Markets could revert here & fall another 50% for all I know (we rallied in April 2014), wouldn’t matter for the long term conviction	cburniske	6	0	1524653311	989093793466060800	https://twitter.com/cburniske/status/989093793466060800				0.27	0.3434	0
