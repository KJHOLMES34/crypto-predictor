bitcoin 	So fiat would need to travel into and out of Bitcoin at a rate of $6bn per hour, so north of $50 trillion/year of volume traded (vs a fraction of that today) and you’re concerned about what, exactly?

	Generally, this has been a precursor of price going up. Tether gets printed when people deposit USD and get USDT back. This USDT will then be used to buy crypto. This is similar to someone depositing $250MM to exchanges. Of course, that doesn't mean they will buy right away.

bitcoin litecoin ethereum 	The problem here is this: With on-chain Bitcoin, Litecoin, Ethereum etc. if you sign and broadcast a transaction to the network (assuming you have internet access), it's going to make it into a block and confirm.
