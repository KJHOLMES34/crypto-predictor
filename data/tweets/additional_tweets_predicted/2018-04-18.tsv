bitcoin 	It’s not a Currency, it’s a token. I think they will all be traded against Bitcoin as the Currency.I think having every asset tradable against Bitcoin rather than USD or EUR or JPY is a very worthy goal and removes the world’s dependency on the US government. Tokens enable that.	SimonDixonTwitt	1	0	1524047931	986554647769788422	https://twitter.com/SimonDixonTwitt/status/986554647769788422				0.22	0.23	0
