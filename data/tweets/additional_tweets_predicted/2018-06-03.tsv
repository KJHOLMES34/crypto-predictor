	It’s the volatility of crypto that makes it hard for low margin business transaction more than the fee. You could lose 2.5% in volatility. This is why cash user case has struggled to get adoption rather than transaction fees IMO.

	Unless your business has a low margin & you have to pay suppliers in fiat then crypto is bad cash. It’s OK for high margin business if you believe in the HODL. That’s why BTC became a store of value as most cash only work when the currency is priced in the same Currency you pay.

	I use a lot of crypto every day.

	I’m curious crypto people - what do you actually use as cash right now? I still find $ ETH $ BTC $ USD and $ USDT more useful as cash over $ BCH at the moment as it is more accepted in the case of $ ETH $ BTC and $ USD or has the stability needed for cash in the case of $ USDT and $ USD.
