ethereum 	Securities Act of ‘33 outlawed Ethereum-type offerings prevalent on Wall St. leading up to ‘29 crash. So yea, ETH is a security. The question is, will the SEC be accommodative? If Goldman lobby’s hard for crypto, they will be. My guess is that SEC blinks.https://cointelegraph.com/news/it-never-was-a-security-ethereum-under-the-regulatory-spotlight …	maxkeiser	118	69	1525639402	993229759223091200	https://twitter.com/maxkeiser/status/993229759223091200				0.22	0.0182	0

	Also, it doesn’t really matter what 87-year old Warren is doing about crypto now. A better question is what would he have been doing when he was in his 20s?
