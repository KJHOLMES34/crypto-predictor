bitcoin 	False. Bitcoin cannot run solely on SPV clients because SPV clients can't mine (effectively), and there's still a bottleneck that the block creating entity has to process a load equal to the entire load of the network during that time. Sharding has none of these issues.	VitalikButerin	6	1	1527285304	1000133170656772096	https://twitter.com/VitalikButerin/status/1000133170656772096				0.17	-0.0593	0

	But perhaps more importantly, I encourage @ RobertJShiller to look at most # cryptoassets as a new means to organize and incentivize human activity, putting them more on par with equities (than monies) as a new means of capitalization (and then later, monetization).	cburniske	24	4	1527255939	1000010006287306753	https://twitter.com/cburniske/status/1000010006287306753		#	@	0.16	0.8503	0
	At risk of making a “TTID” claim, since # cryptoassets ride as natives on the rails of the internet, they have key qualities which set them up for success where other private monies have failed, including viral global growth of faith + 24/7/365 liquidity + broad fungibility.	cburniske	9	0	1527255797	1000009412566814720	https://twitter.com/cburniske/status/1000009412566814720		#		0.26	0.5719	0
	I enjoyed reading this piece from Shiller, as it gives lots of good historical context for # crypto to learn from.https://twitter.com/robertjshiller/status/998609913055207425 …	cburniske	36	11	1527255347	1000007523666137088	https://twitter.com/cburniske/status/1000007523666137088		#		0.38	0.3675	0
	I would argue the opposite. The fuzzy components of # cryptonetworks are critical as a means to organize & incentivize human activity.
