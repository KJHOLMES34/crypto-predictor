bitcoin 	Indeed. @ jerrybrito the contortions gone to in the last paragraph of that article to argue that Bitcoin wasn't for all intents and purposes under one person's control during its inception is a little ridiculous.	neha	4	1	1529084117	1007677939452964864	https://twitter.com/neha/status/1007677939452964864			@	0.09	-0.2792	0
bitcoin 	That doesn't seem like a balanced argument. Bitcoin is a very clear contract: you know exactly what you are buying. The source code is available. And it works as money. It was used to fund Wikileaks when the world blockaded their banking infrastructure.

bitcoin 	The absence of central authorities in blockchain is huge - the ability to convene essentially political power without central authorities is entirely new.
