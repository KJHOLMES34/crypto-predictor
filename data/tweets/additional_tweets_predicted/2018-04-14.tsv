bitcoin 	For the non-private pure-SoV use case, there’s a good argument that Bitcoin is done, should stay simple and decentralized.

bitcoin 	They're worth more, but the amount of money you can make creating TRON vs creating a feature on Bitcoin is very different.

	As far as I know, there are no gains for transferring between 2 wallets that you own. Only gains if it changes hands or gets traded for other crypto (depending on country).	CryptoHustle	3	0	1523722299	985188847536492544	https://twitter.com/CryptoHustle/status/985188847536492544				-0.06	0.1958	0
	Yes, I agree it is a taxable event. So my point is to only use crypto that I'm not personally invested in as a currency and to only have that crypto interface with USD so that I don't incur tax.

	You completely missed my point. If I want to buy something with crypto I can buy LTC with USD and send that (no tax event). If I get paid in LTC n cash out to my bank (no tax event). Since I have no LTC investment I can use it as a currency.
