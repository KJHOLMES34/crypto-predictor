bitcoin 	All banks everywhere will get hit like this. Central Banks are printing trillions more fiat - and failing - to paper over the cracks.

ripple 	So, keep in mind that I’m an outsider and this is just my perspective. Banks, along with every type of payment provider, are encouraged to join RippleNet for access to liquidity. Banks don’t have to know if XRP was used by a market maker. Some banks will become market makers.	haydentiff	2	0	1528564646	1005499119845167106	https://twitter.com/haydentiff/status/1005499119845167106				0.26	0.143	0
