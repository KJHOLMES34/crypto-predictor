bitcoin 	It's not elitist to recognize that a lot of users are not making full use of the security that Bitcoin offers; it means that we have a lot of work to do to encourage better usage and lower the bar for obtaining it.	lopp	17	1	1522616690	980551585557352449	https://twitter.com/lopp/status/980551585557352449				0.07	0.7506	0
	I see coding as a means to an end - bringing a vision for a better future into reality by creating new sets of rules (protocols) to which users can opt-in.

bitcoin 	This is a very interesting nuance, thanks for raising. With bitcoin you’re right; staking makes things interesting because it creates “currency flows” that will indeed compound	cburniske	1	0	1522608794	980518465869090816	https://twitter.com/cburniske/status/980518465869090816				0.31	0.6587	0
	In crypto terms, it’s like opening up a @ lightning channel, where your “deposit” is the initial time spent developing the practice. Once you’ve opened the channel, it never closes so long as you continue to practice. Through that channel, people can connect at a deep place.	cburniske	32	2	1522608579	980517566295797766	https://twitter.com/cburniske/status/980517566295797766			@	0.21	0.1204	0

	That said, a cash position can be crucial for hedge funds & traders, as @ AriDavidPaul has explained. But as someone who buys with a 10-yr time horizon to allow capital to compound without incurring taxes, I don’t dance between crypto <> cash.	cburniske	30	4	1522594348	980457876325060613	https://twitter.com/cburniske/status/980457876325060613			@	0.05	0.1646	0
	I can accumulate $ BTC over time by patiently buying, w/o trying to time sells for every top as a trader would. I have exited to fiat once in my crypto career & at that only a partial position.
