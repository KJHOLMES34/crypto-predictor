bitcoin 	False imo. Satoshi compared Bitcoin to gold (a settlement layer, not a payment mechanism) on 6 separate occasions, and Hal Finney in '10 described the architecture of payments layer built on top of the main chain settlement layer.

bitcoin 	Imo virtue signaling by altcoin proponents that one cares about small tx for the unbanked is usually a straw man interpretation of the bitcoiner's argument that value anchor layer (suitable for large tx settlement) is a necessary prerequisite for payment focused protocol layers.

bitcoin 	Inequality usually refers to the “unfair” advantage of a group or collection of groups. I’m not sure we can say it’s unfair that group x have more Bitcoin a) because we don’t know whether this merry go round will play out well and b) they bought it with lovely legal money. :)	davidbrear	0	0	1522777387	981225596503166978	https://twitter.com/davidbrear/status/981225596503166978				0.08	0.5144	0
