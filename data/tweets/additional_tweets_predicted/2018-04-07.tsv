bitcoin 	It’s not a ‘51% attack,’ it’s a Soros attack. He can corner the # Bitcoin market - as trade war destroys fiat currencies all over the world - and get the same bang! as cornering the Gold market, but for .0125 the cost.	maxkeiser	168	76	1523058880	982406266285903872	https://twitter.com/maxkeiser/status/982406266285903872		#		0.21	-0.436	0
bitcoin 	Think about it, Soros could buy half of the entire # Bitcoin supply and have a gain of approx. $300 billion - as we approach the next halving. He doesn’t have to sell - the halving cuts supply in half for him. A speculator’s dream. This is a non-trivial amount of money.	maxkeiser	441	156	1523057948	982402357383319553	https://twitter.com/maxkeiser/status/982402357383319553		#		0.06	0.0961	0
bitcoin 	Using George Soros’ own theory of ‘reflexivity’ he could manufacture a many, multi-billion dollar # Bitcoin profit for himself, lock/hedge the gain on CME, and use position as collateral to crash currencies all day long with impunity.

bitcoin 	There is a version of bitcoin maximalism in which bitcoin parallels gold, and like gold is not used in daily trade.

	You have to go all the way into cryptologic secessionism - separating the world of mind from matter - to get that kind of freedom. Maybe States would allow it in virtual reality, but the choke points between the physical and virtual are all too real.

	Can crypto central banking survive: can cypherpunks continue to print their own money? Almost certainly not. Almost certainly not. Why? Because anonymity technology is weak. ZKSNARKS don't protect you from network surveillance.

	Cryptography is why we have e-commerce: you can't move credit card numbers without encryption. Trillions of dollars generated in new trade. But no central bank function, of course. This is just trade optimization. And it gives rise to surveillance capitalism.

	I think it's necessary to examine the link between cryptography and cryptocurrency more closely. Implementing a central bank of the internet is a political project.
