	If you analyse the full crypto market, he was right, it was punished. We were in a bull market. BTC rose for sure, everything does in a bull market, but it's dominance lost ground.

bitcoin 	No, Vinny never called bear. He said Bitcoin price should be punished in early 2017 when the scaling deadlock was ongoing, the troll armies attacked. Troll onslaught continued on all calls afterwards.
