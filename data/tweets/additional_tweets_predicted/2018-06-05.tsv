bitcoin 	Looks like $ BCH already has a solution for the high fees! Remove the dust limit and accept zero mining fee transactions. More power to the miners!

bitcoin 	Whereas with LN you can still send extremely cheap transactions for fractions of a sat even if # Bitcoin is at $1 million. So either 1) $ BCHers don't understand it or 2) they only care about making money and once their coin reaches a certain price they don't care about cheap txs.
