bitcoin 	Obviously when Bitcoin is like $100k, the use of LN payments will also increase and the amount that's being paid with it too :)	WhalePanda	7	0	1525005698	990571812676399105	https://twitter.com/WhalePanda/status/990571812676399105				0.21	0.7783	0

bitcoin 	I'm seeing some fud/concern trolling about # Bitcoin LN that some payments over a certain amount fail. 1) LN is in Beta, people put in small amounts since there is always the risk of loss. 2) LN software isn't that user friendly yet. 3) The point of LN is not to send $20+ payments	WhalePanda	238	65	1524997583	990537774083268610	https://twitter.com/WhalePanda/status/990537774083268610		#		0.15	-0.3135	0
