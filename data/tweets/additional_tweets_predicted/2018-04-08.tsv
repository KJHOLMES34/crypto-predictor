	I wish I had not mentioned BTC and Soros. The cryptomaniacs reaction was way out into left field. So what that a big investor wants to enter the market. When he does we will deal with it.

bitcoin 	Bitcoin changes are only decided by hashrate if you decide to defer to hashrate. Bitcoin Cash supporters seem to do that, but Bitcoin supporters tend not to.	lopp	3	0	1523196401	982983067957592064	https://twitter.com/lopp/status/982983067957592064				0.11	0.2022	0

	3/ If you become emotionally swayed every time you study the # crypto markets (be it price action, flows, psychology, etc), then you can't study.	cburniske	10	1	1523205261	983020231789547520	https://twitter.com/cburniske/status/983020231789547520		#		0.16	0.0	0
	2/ For me, it comes down to the way in which the # cryptoasset markets influence your reality. You can learn from the information they provide, without being emotionally swayed.	cburniske	9	1	1523204935	983018865096642560	https://twitter.com/cburniske/status/983018865096642560		#		0.30	0.0	0

	2/ It's particularly interesting to think about the Lindy effect in the context of # cryptoasset prices.

	“The Lindy effect is a concept that the future life expectancy of some non-perishable things like a technology or an idea is proportional to their current age, so that every additional period of survival implies a longer remaining life expectancy.” Lindy is everywhere in # crypto.pic.twitter.com/v2l0jBMGMB	cburniske	260	84	1523192810	982968009324158976	https://twitter.com/cburniske/status/982968009324158976		#		0.43	0.3612	0
