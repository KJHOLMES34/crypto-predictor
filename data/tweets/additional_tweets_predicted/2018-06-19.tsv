bitcoin 	Mass adoption of # Bitcoin is unnecessary. I wouldn’t be surprised if the digital drawbridge gets pulled up and everyone stuck with fiat is left with nothing.	maxkeiser	186	47	1529426969	1009115964611465216	https://twitter.com/maxkeiser/status/1009115964611465216		#		-0.04	-0.0129	0

bitcoin 	I've written about this previously, but the conclusion I reached was that governments would be forced to NOT print fiat or risk devaluation of their currency against Bitcoin.

bitcoin 	Good question, though I don't think it's a simple answer because it would depend upon the amount of traffic your node is routing, which depends upon several variables. A LN node that doesn't route much would be less resource intensive than a bitcoin node.	lopp	2	0	1529439115	1009166909911289861	https://twitter.com/lopp/status/1009166909911289861				0.14	0.2202	0
