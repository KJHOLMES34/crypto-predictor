	"Except that setting up three services is a huge pain, and that's the whole point! The reason crypto-style decentralization can succeed where Disapora-style decentralization via federation failed is precisely because ""no server"" is far better UX than ""choose your own server"""	VitalikButerin	15	6	1528269888	1004262816780390400	https://twitter.com/VitalikButerin/status/1004262816780390400				0.22	-0.0817	0
	The idea that you need two rounds of confirmation to finalize is basically a cornerstone of BFT theory since the 1980s.

	I’m hoping that we can quickly build real value in the crypto economy and start growing the global economy at a faster pace by disrupting the old with the new and unlocking value in society. Speculation alone will not do this - we need real world applications and usage.

	Again, my views are predicated on the fact that relative to the size of the crypto economy there is very little value add to the real world economies still. Disruption takes time but greed and fomo are impatient. When these two collide, the best and worst come to the fore.
