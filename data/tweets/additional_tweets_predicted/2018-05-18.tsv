litecoin 	It's either Namecoin or Ixcoin. I know at one point I also held some Solidcoins. This was mid 2011. Altcoins became a thing in 2011.

	I think it may take longer than 5 years. My guess is that in 20 years, the vast majority of people will be using cryptocurrencies in their daily lives. And some without even knowing that they are.

bitcoin litecoin 	I think of it as fungibility as oppose to anonymity. Fungibility is important for good money, and is one of the missing features from Bitcoin/Litecoin.

	I think it's good. Cryptocurrency needs to be integrated with the current financial systems. So you can't not have the government involved. It's important for us to work with the regulators to make it easy for people to access cryptocurrencies. Just don't ban it! # blockchainchat	SatoshiLite	55	11	1526599376	997256180262092800	https://twitter.com/SatoshiLite/status/997256180262092800		#		0.35	0.2515	0
	The biggest challenge is making it easy to use for the average person. Right now, we are in the early stages, so a lot of work to make things easy to use.
