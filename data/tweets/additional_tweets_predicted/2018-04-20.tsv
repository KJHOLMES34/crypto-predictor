bitcoin 	BCash came into existence as an attempt to strong-arm Bitcoin users and businesses. It was backed and funded by 3 people: Roger Ver, Jihan Wu and Craig Wright.

bitcoin 	$ BCH isn't a scam, but it kinda is. BCash isn't a scam because # Bitcoin is an open-source project and anyone can fork it (and sometimes it feels that almost everyone did at some point).
