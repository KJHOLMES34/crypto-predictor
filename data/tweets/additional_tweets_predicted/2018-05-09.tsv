ethereum 	> And the 20% of coins that devs receive is a big no-no!! It's 10% of coins.

	To expand/clarify: decentralization is important in ensuring a privacy coin survives in the long term. But if I have one transaction I really need to send privately *here and now*, then with the right cryptography centralized systems if available are totally sufficient.
