bitcoin 	My bit gold design in 1998 was 2-layer: bit gold for settlement, Chaumian e-cash for a privacy-enhanced payments layer. I've always thought of Bitcoin as evolving into a settlements-and-large-payments layer that in the long term needed a layer 2 for consumer payments.

	8/ the fact that there is a tremendous amount of homophily (like-mindedness) and co-investing between crypto funds and we're in a bear market. when some of these assets become liquid, there will be tremendous sell pressure and little buy side demand.

	7/ crypto funds have largely driven pre-sale valuations and ICO investing, but had minimal impact on BTC and ETH markets. the problem with owning a lot of illiquid investments is how to wind down these positions. this will be the biggest challenge ahead.

bitcoin 	5/ the larger funds have 24 - 36 month lock ups, and one even has a 10 year lock up. many of the assets that funds have exposure to are illiquid investments in projects slated for launch in late 2018 or 2019. they do have bitcoin exposure, but many also have large cash balances.

	4/ this is because there were limited service providers (fund lawyers, fund administrators, crypto friendly banks) who could onboard so many new funds at once, and many spent a long time setting up the necessary infrastructure to operate.

	2/ that $2.5B is from $500M - $1B in cash and crypto subscriptions, and the rest is AUM growth from funds who started in late 2017. if we apply power laws, there are only a handful of funds with >$100M in AUM. in fact, most funds have far less in AUM.
