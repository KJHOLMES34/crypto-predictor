	My tweet was in response to Trump's policies separating parents from children at the border. Meatspace fascism is not something that can be solved through crypto easily, and my goal was to highlight this fact. That said, I obviously agree improving political incentives is best.

ethereum 	Here's the script: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ethereum/genesis_block_generator/master/mk_genesis_block.py … Doesn't work anymore because many block explorers have shut down, but you get the idea.

ethereum 	In fact, you can do even better. A script to calculate the genesis block is released *at time of sale*, and it's agreed that an ethereum block hash with a height that's a multiple of 500000 is needed as a nonce. The developer just writes software, community launches when ready.	VitalikButerin	131	9	1528690764	1006028096808472576	https://twitter.com/VitalikButerin/status/1006028096808472576				0.14	0.0766	0
ethereum 	This seems backwards. Why can't third parties just run a script to scan the BTC/ETH blockchains, see how much everyone contributed, calculate how much XTZ everyone should get, and generate the genesis block without Tezos Co involvement? That's how the Ethereum launch worked.	VitalikButerin	730	114	1528690446	1006026764341014530	https://twitter.com/VitalikButerin/status/1006026764341014530				0.09	-0.2106	0
