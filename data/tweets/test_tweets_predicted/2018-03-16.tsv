	At the core of everything, crypto is a set of keys. The golden rule is “whoever holds the keys, controls the crypto.” Some people don’t seem to know or care, but for those of us that do, we take key management extremely serious.

	Crypto is keys. Whoever holds the keys, controls the crypto. Some people don’t care whether or not they hold them. Many people don’t even know what crypto is.

bitcoin 	If I understand this correctly (and I may not), users can never be given access to their private keys. Scenario: Bitcoin is $5K and I use it to “buy” $5K of XRP. Then the price of XRP dips, but BTC doubles.

bitcoin 	The first thing I did when I deposited Bitcoin into the wallet was exchange it for $ XRP. I didn’t have to pay the reserve fee. Why not?

bitcoin 	No. You’re not actually buying XRP. It only looks that way. What you’re really buying is a Bitcoin contract that tracks the price of XRP.

bitcoin 	How does this affect $XRP’s liquidity? I “bought” XRP with the app, but it turns out that actually means I bought a BITCOIN contract that tracks the price of XRP.
