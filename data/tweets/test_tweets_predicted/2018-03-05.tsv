	9/ Private investors owning too great a percentage of the # cryptonetwork goes counter to the open ethos of crypto, and by warping incentives can inhibit the network’s fundamental growth.	cburniske	26	3	1520258139	970659105353461761	https://twitter.com/cburniske/status/970659105353461761		#		0.43	0.7506	0
	8/ Last note, regardless of the fund structure, I hope private investors’ early share of a # cryptonetwork stays low in 2018 and beyond.	cburniske	9	2	1520258100	970658943121977345	https://twitter.com/cburniske/status/970658943121977345		#		0.33	0.4588	0
	7/ This isn’t to say a crypto-HF can’t do all of the above (there are some that do the above quite well). It’s more that the HF structure exposes the managers to more of the market, which can distract from an intended long-term focus.	cburniske	12	4	1520258072	970658823265497088	https://twitter.com/cburniske/status/970658823265497088				0.05	-0.2009	0
	6/ A committed investor with deep domain expertise in crypto can help teams w/ strategy, cryptoeconomics, messaging, hiring, dispute resolution, legal matters, and much more, as a traditional equity VC would.	cburniske	34	4	1520258013	970658576481112064	https://twitter.com/cburniske/status/970658576481112064				0.10	0.4019	0
	5/ Even for many of the public cryptoassets, while they have network values in the 10’s or 100’s of millions, they face the trials and tribulations of early-stage startups.	cburniske	14	3	1520257990	970658483027800065	https://twitter.com/cburniske/status/970658483027800065				0.07	0.4019	0
	4/ If specializing in pre-public cryptoassets, the ability to significantly help and focus on the entrepreneurs early is the reason an investor should be given the privilege to get involved in the first place.	cburniske	18	2	1520257972	970658403851874304	https://twitter.com/cburniske/status/970658403851874304				0.24	0.7579	0
	3/ Venture funds have committed capital (e.g., @ placeholdervc’s is 10 years), which shields the fund from redemptions, providing more stable capital & allowing the managers to focus on helping the crypto-entrepreneurs.	cburniske	30	4	1520257940	970658269810298882	https://twitter.com/cburniske/status/970658269810298882			@	0.16	0.6997	0
	2/ We are seeing this already, with many of the prominent crypto hedge funds moving to raise venture capital funds— a good thing for the industry.	cburniske	21	5	1520257886	970658045188550657	https://twitter.com/cburniske/status/970658045188550657				0.23	0.6369	0
	1/ In 2017, the consensus structure to manage cryptoassets was a hedge fund. In 2018, we will see a trend of crypto-specific venture capital funds.	cburniske	140	36	1520257847	970657882441158656	https://twitter.com/cburniske/status/970657882441158656				-0.08	0.0	0
