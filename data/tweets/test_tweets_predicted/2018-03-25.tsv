ripple 	The entire code is in there including the code to start a new $ XRP Ledger. From the command line, execute “rippled --start” and a brand new ledger is started. That’s actually documented in the code and the online documentation provided by @ Ripple. https://github.com/ripple/rippled https://twitter.com/f0nta1n3/status/977959594776506369 …	haydentiff	63	16	1522000831	977968487783194624	https://twitter.com/haydentiff/status/977968487783194624			@	0.27	0.0	0
ripple 	I was confused by RippleNet, as I was stilling referring to the XRP Ledger as the Ripple Network, which it used to be called. Ripple used to be Ripple Labs used to be OpenCoin. XRP used to be called “ripples” and apparently don’t actually have a name, only a currency code.	haydentiff	6	0	1521998401	977958292306702336	https://twitter.com/haydentiff/status/977958292306702336				-0.16	-0.1061	0
ripple 	I’m not of the opinion that how other people spend their crypto is any of my business.

ripple 	All crypto is created by code. Some code is designed to make people jump through hoops to obtain it and some code generates the crypto immediately.

ripple 	I’m not a fan of Rippleco’s branding either but they didn’t do it to be malicious. There was no mining involved in the creation of $ XRP, so calling it “premined” adds to the confusion.
