	My prediction is that the secret driven era of crypto is almost over.

	A more complex strategy was years of regular dinners in which all and sundry across crypto came to my house and talked. What came out of that was models (data compression) and a lexicon (even more DC) to accelerate our thinking. We know how to think about our area better.	leashless	15	3	1521635081	976434419790696448	https://twitter.com/leashless/status/976434419790696448				-0.12	0.1468	0
	So let's think about crypto. My strategy has been to use my hidden knowledge (years in the field) to design a company @ mattereum that ought to prosper whether crypto regulators are harsh or relaxed. Either way, smart contracts and law are here to stay.
