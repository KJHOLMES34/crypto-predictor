bitcoin 	10 minutes. Bitcoin mining is a poisson process. It's memory-less. So at any moment in time, the expected time is always 10 minutes.

bitcoin 	Let's test your knowledge of Bitcoin mining. Bitcoin is designed such that a block is mined every 10 minutes on average.

	Here’s an example of what decentralized regulation could look like from @ ZeppelinOrg: https://twitter.com/zeppelinorg/status/978664882957627392?s=21 … @ MessariCrypto provides another, and what I consider compatible, example.	cburniske	0	1	1522243543	978986492327493632	https://twitter.com/cburniske/status/978986492327493632			@ @	0.08	0.3612	0

	12/ in short, # crypto evolves at a speed unlike any other asset class, placing it outside the control of any nation-state & requiring a dynamic regulatory approach. We, the industry, must welcome working w/ regulators, as opposed to knee-jerk categorizing them as the enemy.	cburniske	79	25	1522243056	978984450083127296	https://twitter.com/cburniske/status/978984450083127296		#		0.13	0.2485	0

	9/ of course, there are many learnings # crypto can borrow from when we were dealing with the birth of other asset classes, such as equities in the 17th century—or perhaps more applicable, ways in which we regulated the internet on a supranational basis (eg, ICANN)	cburniske	15	6	1522242355	978981509788028928	https://twitter.com/cburniske/status/978981509788028928		#		0.04	0.3612	0

	6/ From a regulatory angle, this means we cannot approach # crypto from a centralized perspective. It would be like trying to patch an oil tanker’s hull with bubble gum.	cburniske	38	7	1522241838	978979343996215296	https://twitter.com/cburniske/status/978979343996215296		#		-0.10	0.1806	0
	5/ This is not a knock on @ CoinMarketCap, nor an endorsement of @ wavesplatform, but rather an example of how viral and sprawling activity & experimentation is within the # cryptoasset ecosystem.	cburniske	36	5	1522241585	978978281033695232	https://twitter.com/cburniske/status/978978281033695232		#	@ @	0.33	-0.1232	0
