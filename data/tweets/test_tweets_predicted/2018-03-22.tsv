This is allegedly about some links to websites. Take down sites, issue solved.

bitcoin 	Actually it doesn't show that at all. This should have 0 effect on the Bitcoin price since it's completely irrelevant for Bitcoin as there is no fiat on-ramp. Should also have 0 effect on alts if Binance does its job properly and goes full compliant.
