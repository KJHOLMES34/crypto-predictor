bitcoin 	Backstory: BitMain has used their patents to sue others. They allegedly were using AsicBoost covertly to mine Bitcoin and that's why they were so against SegWit. SegWit blocks covert but not overt AsicBoost boost. AsicBoost gives about a 15% power savings, which is huge. 1/	SatoshiLite	556	221	1520371505	971134598938689536	https://twitter.com/SatoshiLite/status/971134598938689536				0.04	-0.0397	0
bitcoin 	This news went under the radar recently, but I want to highlight this as a HUGE (YUGE!) development in decentralization of Bitcoin mining. Any miner manufacturer that wants to use AsicBoost will need to join BDPL and open up their patents!
