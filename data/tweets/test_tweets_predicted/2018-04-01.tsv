bitcoin 	Why it’s stupid to be a # Bitcoin trader - you might call the bottom & top but what if you get it wrong like 90% & end up with no $ BTC at the end of it.

I myself am constantly promoting education around this point.	lopp	5	0	1522534343	980206197616922624	https://twitter.com/lopp/status/980206197616922624				0.26	0.0818	0
