bitcoin 	This may not last forever either, if Bitcoin ever became a stable global measure of wealth, the “recoupling” also may occur. The reality is that today, crypto assets are traded against BTC sentiment, which is not rational.	VinnyLingham	197	28	1522386868	979587643238420481	https://twitter.com/VinnyLingham/status/979587643238420481				0.16	0.4188	0
	The “decoupling” happens when crypto assets are valued on their intrinsic value, against a more stable measure, not against the fluctuating relative value of BTC. Security tokens in particular will not be coupled to BTC but rather their yield in their respective currencies.
