	That can be solved by getting regulators to accept 3rd party encrypted vaults for storing PII in the name of “regulations”, instead of forcing the companies to do so.

bitcoin 	The Bitcoin scaling problem was effectively solved by forcing merchants to accept other coins for payments, as Bitcoin was changed from a “Medium of Exchange” to a “Store of Value”.

	There is a difference between investing and trading. This is why a proprietary trader / hedge fund manager has a diffeeebt job to a fund manager / research analysts at a bank. Of course emotions drive markets, but trading and investing require two different skills.

	Most people have jobs and are not professional traders. If your not a professional trader you will get eaten alive trying to trade. That is my simple message.

	I call that technicals. Put another way - traders trade short term technicals and the emotions of fear and greed. Investors hold into a fundamental thesis. It’s a very different thing. You can be a great trader or a great Investor but most in $ BTC can invest, few can trade.

	The fundamentals of fiat are it will always be inflated or deflated based upon the goals of the country and the credit risk appetite of banks.

	Most people, of course, are innumerate, and they don't know how much to worry about low probability events. You shouldn't worry about hash collisions or today's CPUs flipping bits.

	For additional information about the Mormon faith and it's relationship to the future of humanity, please see https://transfigurism.org/  it's extremely surprising and very, very well thought out.	leashless	14	2	1522574233	980373507593908224	https://twitter.com/leashless/status/980373507593908224			
	After long and rigourous analysis and soul searching, I've decided to become Mormon. Of the Western religions, it has the clearest and broadest metaphysics, very similar in scope to Hinduism. They smile, run their own welfare state and stockpile food: a good fit on every level.	leashless	92	7	1522573137	980368912729694208	https://twitter.com/leashless/status/980368912729694208			
	Yeah. And I see that model as being fundamentally flawed. Holo, if it succeeds, will succeed in spite of that world model, not because of it IMHO. But let's see what happens. I don't want to discourage anybody from writing code and launching systems!	leashless	0	0	1522568353	980348847435198464	https://twitter.com/leashless/status/980348847435198464			
	And in high schools, they'll use these mechanisms to outcaste the nerds or the Jews or the immigrants. On an uncensorable, invisible network. You think nice people will use good tools in nice ways.

	"It's not ""minus capitslism"" - people will implement capitslism on Holochain, just like they implement capitslism on top of anarchism.

	The question you must ask is this: how would the Russian oligarchy have used this technology during the collapse of the Soviet union. How would the cocaine cartels use it today? https://www.wired.com/2012/11/zeta-radio/ … this is worth reading, and understanding.

	People, there is nothing controversial about the idea: it's called rule of law. When it breaks down, you have failed states! Most blockchains don't screw with rule of law very much in practice.

	Oh it's not very complicated, as these things go. It's a signature scheme. No deep reliance on SNARKS or other moon math. I'm sure it'll be as hard to get right as any other crypto is, maybe a bit harder, given the scaling ambitions. But it's worth a try. Why not?	leashless	0	0	1522546455	980256999211438080	https://twitter.com/leashless/status/980256999211438080			
	You're entitled to try. It'll likely go about the way these things always do. But you're very invested in your vision, and deeply resistant to any data that would contradict it, and that should be all the warning that anybody needs. Holochain may work inspite of this. Maybe.	leashless	1	0	1522545996	980255075418431488	https://twitter.com/leashless/status/980255075418431488			
	No, Art. No. I mean, I could waste precious sleeping time tearing your position apart, but I won't. Your subculture is basically a hangover from the 1960s, and people keep spinning the dials hoping this time it will be different, while the poor starve and the world burns.	leashless	1	0	1522545901	980254676594634757	https://twitter.com/leashless/status/980254676594634757			
	They've put an awful lot of work into the ideology. Tons. Nearly all the defensiveness you see from the team can be answered by working software, of course.	leashless	2	0	1522544976	980250795521249280	https://twitter.com/leashless/status/980250795521249280			
	I'd need to see evidence of this claim. Since the 1960s the community thing has been a strong attractor, but for very little good result when measured against the energy and lives that went in. Overall I'd say it's been net negative, like most drug culture.	leashless	0	0	1522544890	980250435796815873	https://twitter.com/leashless/status/980250435796815873
