	By simply sending a person a FB video or IG image/video, you're exposing them to be tracked by FB because it's embedded. When it is simply a link that opens in a browser upon click, the user you're chatting with has the choice of being tracked or not by clicking.	ummjackson	3	0	1526765728	997953910487699456	https://twitter.com/ummjackson/status/997953910487699456

	The paper introduces a big protocol family that can be used in many different configurations.

	I wouldn't be quick to concede this point. We don't know if a single miner will drop out due to resource requirements (after all, the mining rig costs are far more than the disk and CPU required), and systems such as bloXroute address the orphan problem in the network.	el33th4xor	5	0	1526736104	997829660124897281	https://twitter.com/el33th4xor/status/997829660124897281

	Actual logical reasoning to me is determined by thorough statistical analysis of actual trading performance. I trust numbers, not some narrative.

	I am a swing trader in futures and forex, so an 18-day is a quick simple proxy for trend. If I was a scalper or position trader I would have a different time frame.	PeterLBrandt	25	2	1526759920	997929550523777024	https://twitter.com/PeterLBrandt/status/997929550523777024

	Depends whether you are trading for a scalp, swing trade or position trade. Agree that it can be sold with tight stop loss, but my rule is to never trade against a simple MA.

	As men mature, they understand that life is not fair, that sex isn't a game, that dating and mating requires some effort. These guys are angry misfits, who think everyone's having a big orgy they weren't invited to. (They're not entirely wrong, but that's not really the point.)

	There's an in-your-face aspect to modern sexuality that even I (a product of the 70s and the 80s) find astonishingly vulgar and open. Now imagine you're a 20-something living in that, wondering: why them, and not you? If you're maladjusted and immature, it stokes adolescent rage.

	They live in a world where they see men around them having a lot of access to uncommitted sex with multiple women. But they don't have that same access. There is no culture of one-on-one dating; it's a pornified culture of hookups, in which they can never participate.

	At least he didn't try to lie. But I guess the situation in the cockpit of USA Election Flight 93 was less congenial than he might have thought.	RadioFreeTom	9	0	1526681342	997599973431808000	https://twitter.com/RadioFreeTom/status/997599973431808000

	I didn't know who Patricia Morgan was - she's @ PatriciaforRI, apparently, and running for the GOP nom for governor - but after her third unbelievably annoying robo-call to me, I'm about ready to vote against her even if she's one of God's archangels.
