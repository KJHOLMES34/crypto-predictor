	I'm obviously referring to concurrency at the low level, ie. transaction-by-transaction. Basically, in a sharded model, it's fine if transactions within a shard can't be processed in parallel, because different shards can already be processed in parallel anyway.

	There *are* pros to slavery. I remember learning in school (Canada) that after slavery was abolished, they tried to de-facto reinstitute it via programs like convict lease, which was sometimes *worse* b/c the foremen no longer had incentive to care about slaves' long-term health.

	That's a nice justification for your racist outbursts, Alan, but it's simply not true. You're going after me because I stood up for myself in the face of racist abuse. I don't see you on this kind of crusade except to put more hate on this particular brown man.

	The slaves you own are in China and India making your Macintoshes and your phones. But they're still slaves, and you're angry that I've punctured your illusion of guilt-laden luxury.

	Alan, it's nothing to do with social justice. It's very simple: all the wealth you have was originally made by murder.
