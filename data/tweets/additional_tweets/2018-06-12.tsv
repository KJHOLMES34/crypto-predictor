	> Quicker consensus is an approach to scaling too right? Absolutely not. The truly fundamental scaling bottleneck has nothing to do with consensus algos, it has to do with the fact that in naively implemented blockchains every node needs to process every tx.

	Blockchains actually can help to achieve some guarantees (eg. by hosting the vote on one, you can prove that people weren't unfairly denied the chance to participate). The recent (non-blockchain-based) EOS genesis vote was criticized because of precisely this issue I believe.

	Of course not. But putting a list of valid public keys onto a blockchain could be a reasonable thing to do.	VitalikButerin	3	4	1528796212	1006470378015735810	https://twitter.com/VitalikButerin/status/1006470378015735810

	Trusted-setup-free STARKs are making great progress recently. Also, trusted setup once again isn't as big of an issue because petitions are non-binding.	VitalikButerin	4	5	1528790002	1006444334034505729	https://twitter.com/VitalikButerin/status/1006444334034505729

	Governments looking to use blockchains for IDs + voting should consider starting with petitions. It's a safer use case because petitions are non-binding so security risks are much smaller, but you can still take advantage of blockchains for verifiability and ZKPs for privacy.

bitcoin 	Bitcoin also has an economic attack surface which is as yet, untested. What happens in a world where miners have alternatives and the Bitcoin price drops below marginal cost of production.

	5/ Public speaking has brought me a lot over the past 10 years, I'm really glad I stuck with it.

	2/ I had bad social anxiety at the time. I'm pretty sure it took me 4 years before I attempted public speaking again - an occasion where I didn't have money to pay for a conference.

	Ok: getting off and back on apparently worked— “the count is right”— but flight attendants say they don’t know what the issue was / can’t tell us.

	A strange thing happening on Southwest flight 2030 (Nashville to LAX): everyone is on board and we are all seated and ready to take off, but they’ve realized 1 extra person is on board who shouldn’t be, so they are checking every single person’s ID one by one. dramatic tension.	readDanwrite	18	1	1528835283	1006634255697567745	https://twitter.com/readDanwrite/status/1006634255697567745

	Cryptocurrencies are often used by scammers as a buy in rail for pyramid schemes, so countries with a weak immune system against pyramid schemes find it easier to ban crypto outright.	el33th4xor	4	0	1528802819	1006498090591969280	https://twitter.com/el33th4xor/status/1006498090591969280

	The reasons for this are simple, due to two opposing forces: 1. These technologies confer a geopolitical advantage, 2.

	What makes them Feudal? 1) users have no rights. 2) contributors have no rights. 3) in most cases there is no governance. 4) forks are often wars, sometimes wars of succession. 5) the king has all the power. 6) the king can't do anything without contributors. Feudal balances.	leashless	1	0	1528799846	1006485621572100096	https://twitter.com/leashless/status/1006485621572100096			
	Open Source projects revolve around a maintainer, usually the founder, almost always a white male, who works himself into a hole in the ground, often without pay, for the benefit of other people.

	This is not even close to true. MySQL is Monty, who wrote a million lines of code. PHP had a leader who quit, and is an aimless dog's breakfast of a language.
