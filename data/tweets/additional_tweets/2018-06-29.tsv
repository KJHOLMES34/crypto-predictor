	The maximalists keep asserting that no miner would cross 51% or launch double spend attacks. But BTC crossed 51% three times in its history and a miner double spent repeatedly using its hash power. These people have broken models and a flawed understanding of game theory.	el33th4xor	0	0	1530299307	1012774816498241537	https://twitter.com/el33th4xor/status/1012774816498241537			
	It's a token that corresponds to memory space on block producers. It is controlled exclusively by BPs, who speculate on it, as well as determine its supply.

	Today's EOS Store of Drama: A block producer buys up RAM, driving the price up, making it harder for people to cheaply deploy Dapps on the platform. Standard tragedy of the commons. Also, expect collusion, where BPs keep RAM prices artificially elevatedhttps://www.reddit.com/r/eos/comments/8us5p1/eos_nation_bp_speculating_on_ram_sold_all_today/?utm_content=title&utm_medium=front&utm_source=reddit&utm_name=eos …	el33th4xor	102	28	1530294514	1012754715728318466	https://twitter.com/el33th4xor/status/1012754715728318466			
	But PoW externalizes the entry step: it's not in-protocol, so that's nice, but now all kinds of shenanigans involving access to the mining rigs take place off chain. In fact, centralization occurs outside the protocol, where it cannot be controlled.	el33th4xor	4	0	1530285512	1012716956347232256	https://twitter.com/el33th4xor/status/1012716956347232256

	Almost all of these proposals are flawed because they will grant an enormous head start to people in charge of selecting the new PoW algo.

	That's not technically true: orphaning is a real threat in PoW, and more importantly, hardware manufacturers can refuse to sell to selected entities. PoS needs to be immutable and censor-proof. 21 BPs organized into cartels won't cut it.	el33th4xor	6	0	1530284048	1012710818155286528	https://twitter.com/el33th4xor/status/1012710818155286528

	Other people cannot report him as an impersonator for me. You guys make that difficult. I cannot report him as an impersonator because he blocked me.

	Hey @ gasca, Cryptospam is awful and brazen. Here's a simple fix for it: Spammer S blocks me, responds to me, and you guys show his tweet to everyone who clicks on my tweet.

	BTW transaction rate is a red herring. It's the value transmitted by the chain that is more telling. Also low value dust level spam attacks pre Segwit is not to be discounted. It inflated the transaction rate previously.	woonomic	1	1	1530301087	1012782283542224896	https://twitter.com/woonomic/status/1012782283542224896			
bitcoin 	This chart will show you a bit more clearly the transaction rate http://charts.woobull.com/bitcoin-transactions-per-second/ …. Note the drop whenever the markets crashed. This is super imposed on an increasing user base. Then we hit the ceiling and now we also have drops from batching.	woonomic	0	1	1530300945	1012781687690944512	https://twitter.com/woonomic/status/1012781687690944512			
bitcoin 	We have full node Bitcoin clients and light clients using third party nodes for on chain Bitcoin wallets. This is not that different IMO. The option is there not to use 3rd parties. But U should ask a LN expert their thoughts.	woonomic	0	1	1530290949	1012739760400621569	https://twitter.com/woonomic/status/1012739760400621569			
	Combination of bear market (most transactional volume is speculative trading and investment) and batching. 2016-17 was bull. That amplifies tx volume.	woonomic	2	0	1530290449	1012737664590778368	https://twitter.com/woonomic/status/1012737664590778368			
	That's my chart, over a year ago. Since then Segwit adoption has kept up with transactional demand, buying enough time for layer 2 scaling. Block fill ratio is now low enough that financial incentives for miners to spam the network into congestion is now out of reach. # propagandahttps://twitter.com/rogerkver/status/1012442620956741632 …	woonomic	294	81	1530288667	1012730190492065792	https://twitter.com/woonomic/status/1012730190492065792		#

	I was a vocal critic of the Tea Party and the growing know-nothingism in the GOP. I often split my vote for GOPers and Dems.
