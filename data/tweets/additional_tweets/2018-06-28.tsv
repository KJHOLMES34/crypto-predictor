bitcoin 	My bit gold design in 1998 was 2-layer: bit gold for settlement, Chaumian e-cash for a privacy-enhanced payments layer. I've always thought of Bitcoin as evolving into a settlements-and-large-payments layer that in the long term needed a layer 2 for consumer payments.

	i could see $5B + at peak - i think Polychain's filings had them at over $1B in late 2017, so into 2018 that would have been closer to 1.5 or 2. i wonder how they're marking pre-sale coins etc. VC does mark based on latest raise, so lots of paper gains if its marked this way.

	9/ this chart from @ ICO_Analytics highlights this. look at the common investments among some of the larger, better-known funds. in a bull market with a lot of retail investors willing to buy bags from these funds, this wasn't problem. in a bear market, who's the natural buyer?pic.twitter.com/i8lENPuqFu	Melt_Dem	144	41	1530192081	1012325080557346816	https://twitter.com/Melt_Dem/status/1012325080557346816			@
	8/ the fact that there is a tremendous amount of homophily (like-mindedness) and co-investing between crypto funds and we're in a bear market. when some of these assets become liquid, there will be tremendous sell pressure and little buy side demand.

	7/ crypto funds have largely driven pre-sale valuations and ICO investing, but had minimal impact on BTC and ETH markets. the problem with owning a lot of illiquid investments is how to wind down these positions. this will be the biggest challenge ahead.	Melt_Dem	26	3	1530191881	1012324238269800448	https://twitter.com/Melt_Dem/status/1012324238269800448			
	"6/ i think the sell pressure from crypto funds will be extremely minimal. crypto funds are small, relatively speaking, and the crypto ""buy side"" is dominated by extremely large OTC players that can eat up orders on either side of the book."

bitcoin 	5/ the larger funds have 24 - 36 month lock ups, and one even has a 10 year lock up. many of the assets that funds have exposure to are illiquid investments in projects slated for launch in late 2018 or 2019. they do have bitcoin exposure, but many also have large cash balances.

	4/ this is because there were limited service providers (fund lawyers, fund administrators, crypto friendly banks) who could onboard so many new funds at once, and many spent a long time setting up the necessary infrastructure to operate.

	3/ there's 1 fund with > $1B in AUM, 3 funds > $250M AUM, maybe 10 funds > $100M AUM, and a long tail of smaller funds with $5 - $50M in AUM. many funds were formed in 2017, but most weren't able to begin taking subscriptions until late fall or early 2018.

	2/ that $2.5B is from $500M - $1B in cash and crypto subscriptions, and the rest is AUM growth from funds who started in late 2017. if we apply power laws, there are only a handful of funds with >$100M in AUM. in fact, most funds have far less in AUM.

	1/ reflecting on recent comments on the forced sale / liquidation that might be coming for crypto funds, and thinking through the impact on crypto markets. making some assumptions here, but say there are 250 crypto funds that have $2.5B in AUM collectively.

	But if you don't have time for that, you should check out John Oliver's recent segment on China and Xi Jinping, if you haven't already. The one that got him completely banned on China's internet.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OubM8bD9kck …	prchovanec	1	0	1530158408	1012183843829440512	https://twitter.com/prchovanec/status/1012183843829440512			
	So many good books on China, but for a good and timely overview from a US policy perspective, I'd recommend the following. @ LizEconomy is a great friend, and she knows her stuff. https://www.amazon.com/Third-Revolution-Jinping-Chinese-State/dp/0190866071/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1530158278&sr=8-1&keywords=the+third+revolution+xi+jinping+and+the+new+chinese+state …	prchovanec	2	0	1530158318	1012183466262302721	https://twitter.com/prchovanec/status/1012183466262302721			@
	I know TPP may not be very popular among your fans, but negotiating it and then walking away from it abruptly the way we did, did nothing to enhance Asian regional perceptions of how reliably the US keeps its commitments.	prchovanec	2	0	1530157900	1012181713500475392	https://twitter.com/prchovanec/status/1012181713500475392			
	A lot of countries in Asia look to the US as a positive balancing force in Asia, in terms of security, economics, and democratic values. If that presence isn't there, they will make different accommodations.	prchovanec	1	0	1530157686	1012180816930144256	https://twitter.com/prchovanec/status/1012180816930144256			
	... but I also think that if the US fails to stand up for its friends, its core interests, and international rules in the region - consistent with a recognition of China's own legitimate interests and concerns - we will invite more trouble not very far down the road.	prchovanec	1	0	1530157581	1012180374674386944	https://twitter.com/prchovanec/status/1012180374674386944

	You and I probably wouldn't agree on many issues. But a bipartisan foreign policy on certain core issues - such as our relationships with existing allies, and a willingness to protect the International commons, e.g. vital sea lanes - has been a hallmark of US policy for 70 years.	prchovanec	1	0	1530157313	1012179252391960577	https://twitter.com/prchovanec/status/1012179252391960577

	My sense is that the entire issue was put on the sidelines as Trump tried to woo China's support in putting pressure on North Korea. Now that US-China trade tensions are rising, and China's cooperation on North Korea looks cloudy, it could come back on the table.	prchovanec	1	0	1530156871	1012177397964210176	https://twitter.com/prchovanec/status/1012177397964210176

	"Furthermore, Trump Jr states ""I don't think Obama ever broke 2%"". He thinks wrong. US GDP growth was 2.5% in 2010, 2.2% in 2012, 2.6% in 2014, and 2.9% in 2015. Clearly, by that measure, 2018 is looking good. So why lie about previous GDP numbers?"	prchovanec	12	5	1530149067	1012144665842343936	https://twitter.com/prchovanec/status/1012144665842343936			
	We'll see what 2Q18 delivers - it's looking like between 3-5%. But even with this good news, the IMF is still projecting 2.9% US GDP growth for 2018 as a whole, not 3% or higher as Trump Jr. claims.	prchovanec	13	1	1530148816	1012143610458984448	https://twitter.com/prchovanec/status/1012143610458984448			
	Again, they confuse quarterly GDP figures with annual ones (not to mention often flawed projections with real numbers). Annualized quarterly GDP reached at least 4% four times under Obama (4Q11, 4Q13, 2Q14, 3Q14). In 3Q14 it even hit 5.2%. Of course, it didn't stay there.https://twitter.com/DonaldJTrumpJr/status/1011991818945351680 …	prchovanec	47	29	1530148585	1012142644045189120	https://twitter.com/prchovanec/status/1012142644045189120

	Appointments require the Senate's advice and consent. On Garland, the Senate refused its consent. You can argue with its reasons for doing so, but not its constitutional authority.

	Yeah, no. Dan's challenged me to write a longer response, but I just don't have the energy to keep arguing past each other. I see Trump as an existential threat; he sees him as sub-optimal, and thus worth keeping the GOP enablers in power despite Trump's flaws. No space to agree.
