bitcoin ethereum 	Oh, bitcoin maximalism is/was very real. It's a very specific ideology that was quite prevalent in 2014, and the term became popular precisely *because* the concept was.

	That is one of the most misinterpreted conversation logs ever. The purpose of stopping trading and withdrawing and depositing was to make sure that the DAO hacker could not get any money out.

	Nope, just the sender and the DAO. This doesn't make ether itself reversible; it's a separate token that's backed by ether, and where withdrawing your tokens into ether also has an N day delay period during which reversals could happen.

ethereum 	Classic Freudian slip! On Ethereum Classic, hard to see the supporters of a post-hard fork chain being held to account for the actions of those who originally funded its development. Presumably both ETH and ETC would be regulated as securities on exchanges, though.	mikejcasey	1	0	1524206060	987217885029335040	https://twitter.com/mikejcasey/status/987217885029335040			
	I don't think this is really that surprising. If SEC is taking the view that nearly all ICOs are securities, it can't very well be inconsistent and exempt ether. The bigger question is what kind of retroactive remediation do they do and against whom?	mikejcasey	10	2	1524179974	987108475707772929	https://twitter.com/mikejcasey/status/987108475707772929

bitcoin 	"""Fraud: wrongful or criminal deception intended to result in financial or personal gain.""

bitcoin 	"Everyone started calling out CSW as what he is: a clear fraud, which is a good start but that's where it stops for most people. It isn't enough. Roger Ver and friends are clearly committing fraud every time they claims that BCash is Bitcoin and when they says ""Bitcoin (BCH)""."

bitcoin 	BCash came into existence as an attempt to strong-arm Bitcoin users and businesses. It was backed and funded by 3 people: Roger Ver, Jihan Wu and Craig Wright. Again: no issue with them forking off, their choice and they want to try to take a different route, which is fine.

bitcoin 	$ BCH isn't a scam, but it kinda is. BCash isn't a scam because # Bitcoin is an open-source project and anyone can fork it (and sometimes it feels that almost everyone did at some point).
