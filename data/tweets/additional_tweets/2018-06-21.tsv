	I think there is a lot of aimless tinkering going on right now, yeah. My point was really that developing a blockchain from scratch is a very niche skill.

	Absolutely, for sure. Creating new blockchains from scratch is itself a niche - that's my point.	ummjackson	2	0	1529547697	1009622336532725760	https://twitter.com/ummjackson/status/1009622336532725760

	That's kind of my point - there are *plenty* of users for regular web/mobile apps. Developers focusing the next 1-2 years on blockchain could potentially be limiting their long-term career opportunities as it's a specialty field vs. more generalist programming.	ummjackson	3	0	1529547654	1009622154395045889	https://twitter.com/ummjackson/status/1009622154395045889

	That's a portable skillset that applies across a variety of companies, industries etc. Blockchain is a very specific skill set and the #of jobs is going to be limited once consolidation in the industry happens.	ummjackson	0	0	1529547537	1009621665666367488	https://twitter.com/ummjackson/status/1009621665666367488		#of	
	It's just such a specialty field that I don't recommend every developer go and try to focus their career on it. Many more career opportunities for generalists.	ummjackson	5	0	1529547459	1009621336623230976	https://twitter.com/ummjackson/status/1009621336623230976			
	This doesn't need to be a binary observation. There can very well be too much of *everything* in blockchain.

bitcoin 	34/ TL;DR Governments use monetary intervention as a swiss army knife for society’s problems. This undermines the function of money and has unintended consequences. Politically neutral protocols like Bitcoin could be superior because they are reliable, robust, and modular.	TuurDemeester	50	15	1529596259	1009826019069620224	https://twitter.com/TuurDemeester/status/1009826019069620224			
bitcoin 	33/ And so I see Bitcoin as a small but performant monetary building block that can serve to diminish interpersonal conflict in society. Much technology and many institutions will need to be built around it, no doubt. But it’s an exhilarating start.

	32/ I’m a strong believer in modular scaling, and I think history backs me up on this: that robust complex systems (including prosperous, thriving societies) are consistently built out of simple, performant mechanisms that lock into each other in a modular way.

	31/ Here’s is the problem I see with monetary interventionism: it is trying to solve many problems using the same toolset, resulting in unintended consequences and an ultimately unreliable monetary infrastructure.	TuurDemeester	24	3	1529596258	1009826015596736518	https://twitter.com/TuurDemeester/status/1009826015596736518			
bitcoin 	30/ Of course, Bitcoin in itself isn’t going to solve all the interpersonal problems that governments are trying to solve. But it holds the promise of doing one thing extremely well: be a reliable form of money.	TuurDemeester	24	5	1529596258	1009826014594322432	https://twitter.com/TuurDemeester/status/1009826014594322432			
bitcoin 	29/ Bitcoin diminishes conflicts by means of technology, much like how car locks diminish car thefts. It’s a protocol that allows users to peacefully enforce their right to control their own financial future.	TuurDemeester	29	10	1529596257	1009826013428281346	https://twitter.com/TuurDemeester/status/1009826013428281346			
bitcoin 	28/ And so, paradoxically, by efficiently removing free access to a scarce monetary good, Bitcoin becomes a socially scalable technological enforcer of property rights.	TuurDemeester	25	3	1529596257	1009826011654098944	https://twitter.com/TuurDemeester/status/1009826011654098944			
bitcoin 	27/ This triple combo allows for bitcoin to be highly divisible, highly portable and scalable, highly durable (predictable supply curve), and therefore it holds the promise of a universally desirable store of value and medium of exchange.	TuurDemeester	22	4	1529596257	1009826010609672192	https://twitter.com/TuurDemeester/status/1009826010609672192			
bitcoin 	26/ On the contrary, Bitcoin is an incredibly powerful startup currency _because_ it fully enables plurality, scarcity, and diversity.	TuurDemeester	15	2	1529596257	1009826009728933888	https://twitter.com/TuurDemeester/status/1009826009728933888			
bitcoin 	25/ But Bitcoin doesn’t touch at all on the three other categories of conflict-causes. Isn’t that a setback?	TuurDemeester	16	2	1529596084	1009825286568009734	https://twitter.com/TuurDemeester/status/1009825286568009734			
bitcoin 	24/ This core ability to restrict free access is not dependent on the decision of a political committee, but rather innate, hardwired in the technology. To borrow from Nick Szabo, Bitcoin is a socially scalable, conflict preventing protocol.	TuurDemeester	31	3	1529596084	1009825285653651456	https://twitter.com/TuurDemeester/status/1009825285653651456			
bitcoin 	23/ However, there is one cause of conflict that Bitcoin does _not_ allow for: free access. Nobody can mint bitcoins in excess of the 21M supply, and with sufficient precautions taken, existing coins can be protected against access from anyone anywhere.	TuurDemeester	23	3	1529596084	1009825284558909442	https://twitter.com/TuurDemeester/status/1009825284558909442			
bitcoin 	22/ Bitcoin 100% allows for plurality and diversity: anyone can use it, and the network is censorship resistant - opening the door for any and all diversity. It is also decidedly a scarce good.	TuurDemeester	23	2	1529596083	1009825283615154176	https://twitter.com/TuurDemeester/status/1009825283615154176			
	21/ Remember, there are 4 necessary and jointly sufficient causes for conflict: Plurality - multiple actors Free access - what actors want is accessible to them Scarcity - desired good is in finite supply Diversity - actors have different values, opinions, preferences	TuurDemeester	21	3	1529596083	1009825282654724097	https://twitter.com/TuurDemeester/status/1009825282654724097			
bitcoin 	20/ Now, let’s switch to Bitcoin. In what ways could Bitcoin contribute to diminishing interpersonal conflict?	TuurDemeester	17	3	1529596083	1009825281673179137	https://twitter.com/TuurDemeester/status/1009825281673179137			
	19/ Finally “social consensus” appears manageable in times of credit expansion, but obviously breaks down in a phase of deleveraging or stagflation. It is unreliable as a conflict prevention mechanism and it’s impossible to prove it offers a net benefit to society.	TuurDemeester	18	2	1529596083	1009825280679141376	https://twitter.com/TuurDemeester/status/1009825280679141376			
	18/ Third, the monetary abundance isn’t divided evenly over the population - credit expansion & bailouts generally favor debtors to the detriment of savers (causing conflict). And fourth, the resulting inflation undermines the money’s long term desirability.	TuurDemeester	27	3	1529596082	1009825278074507264	https://twitter.com/TuurDemeester/status/1009825278074507264			
	17/ First, over time, central banks hardly ever remain free from political influence (lack of unity). Second, certain groups do get “free access” to newly minted money, for example those who are labeled “too big to fail”, or those allowed to engage in fractional reserve banking.	TuurDemeester	27	4	1529596082	1009825276476493830	https://twitter.com/TuurDemeester/status/1009825276476493830			
	16/ So the ways in which government uses monetary technology to try and prevent societal conflicts is very comprehensive. However, in my opinion this approach suffers from some systemic flaws:	TuurDemeester	15	2	1529596081	1009825273762795521	https://twitter.com/TuurDemeester/status/1009825273762795521			
	15/ And finally, governments also pursue monetary consensus: by means of marketing and regulation, citizens are pursued to only use one money (national currency) and to endorse the local monetary policy.	TuurDemeester	19	4	1529596081	1009825272122757120	https://twitter.com/TuurDemeester/status/1009825272122757120			
	14/ Government money is abundant: when scarcity threatens to cause conflict, new money is made available to particular groups.	TuurDemeester	24	5	1529596080	1009825271229370368	https://twitter.com/TuurDemeester/status/1009825271229370368			
	13/ Governments curb free access: a unit of fiat money can only be owned by one person at a time, and counterfeiting generally is penalized.	TuurDemeester	20	3	1529596080	1009825270352760832	https://twitter.com/TuurDemeester/status/1009825270352760832			
	12/ Government managed money restricts plurality: there is only one entity (e.g. FOMC) which ultimately controls interest rates and money supply. The central bank has the undisputed authority and bears ultimate responsibility.	TuurDemeester	20	4	1529596080	1009825268645683200	https://twitter.com/TuurDemeester/status/1009825268645683200			
	11/ Over time, governments have started using the institution of money, surely for their own self interest, but also to try and address interpersonal conflict in society. Let’s look at how:	TuurDemeester	23	3	1529596080	1009825267756470273	https://twitter.com/TuurDemeester/status/1009825267756470273			
	10/ In order for money to reliably serve as that near universal “key to markets”, it must acquire several characteristics: durability, portability, divisibility, and widespread desirability.	TuurDemeester	24	5	1529596079	1009825265957134336	https://twitter.com/TuurDemeester/status/1009825265957134336			
	9/ Enter money, a technology that helps to prevent conflict by giving people a highly marketable good that they can use to access a variety of goods and services on a non-coercive basis (i.e. providing abundance by meeting needs & wants).	TuurDemeester	22	3	1529596079	1009825264883453953	https://twitter.com/TuurDemeester/status/1009825264883453953			
	8/ In a pre-money, barter world, people don’t have a lot of possibilities to get their needs and wants met. Even division of labor is hard: if I’m a cobbler, I can’t get eggs until the chicken farmer needs a new pair of shoes.	TuurDemeester	20	3	1529596079	1009825263897718784	https://twitter.com/TuurDemeester/status/1009825263897718784			
	7/ Now let’s apply this framework to money.	TuurDemeester	15	3	1529596078	1009825261213442051	https://twitter.com/TuurDemeester/status/1009825261213442051			
	6/ Rather than creating abundance by ramping up production, one can also create it by diminishing one’s (perceived) needs and wants: asceticism. This was especially popular in premodern times (monasticism), and can still be found in many spiritual/religious teachings.	TuurDemeester	31	6	1529596078	1009825260110270464	https://twitter.com/TuurDemeester/status/1009825260110270464			
	5/ In the political world, conflict prevention is usually more sought after in the areas of plurality & diversity (solutions of unity & consensus), whereas the business world focuses more on removing scarcity and restricting access (solutions of abundance and private property).	TuurDemeester	23	5	1529596078	1009825259174944769	https://twitter.com/TuurDemeester/status/1009825259174944769			
	4/ Example: There is one pancake in the room (scarcity & access), and you and I both want it (plurality & diversity). If I convince you that I should have the pancake (removing diversity), the conflict disappears. Another solution is to bake more pancakes (removing scarcity).	TuurDemeester	24	4	1529596077	1009825257417592832	https://twitter.com/TuurDemeester/status/1009825257417592832			
	3/ If one manages to completely remove just one of the four necessary causes, it effectively resolves and prevents interpersonal conflict.	TuurDemeester	20	3	1529596077	1009825256574476288	https://twitter.com/TuurDemeester/status/1009825256574476288			
	2/ All interpersonal conflict has 4 necessary and jointly sufficient causes: Plurality - multiple actors Free access - what actors want is accessible to them Scarcity - desired good is in finite supply Diversity - actors have different values, opinions, preferences	TuurDemeester	35	3	1529596077	1009825255018389505	https://twitter.com/TuurDemeester/status/1009825255018389505			
bitcoin 	1/ In this thread I make a philosophical argument for Bitcoin being a socially scalable contribution to conflict prevention in society, contrasting it with the current system of monetary interventionism.

	With sufficiently secure and global decentralization, what lawyers think will be quite a bit less important than it is for centralized exchanges.	NickSzabo4	44	4	1529614337	1009901843432869888	https://twitter.com/NickSzabo4/status/1009901843432869888			
bitcoin 	Volatility in Bitcoin from temporary uncertainty about its future (vs. both political opposition & crypto competitors), not from its supply limit. As these uncertainties decline its volatility will decline until it reflects more the uncertainty in fiat than its own.	NickSzabo4	1601	466	1529611562	1009890204474208256	https://twitter.com/NickSzabo4/status/1009890204474208256			
	Basically that. Moving thousands or millions of dollars around the globe calls for very different security vs. performance trade-offs and other desiderata than buying coffee at the local store; in a digital world they should be done at different protocol layers.

	Better key management is at least as important as a good layer2, but otherwise yes.	NickSzabo4	8	0	1529608725	1009878306852777984	https://twitter.com/NickSzabo4/status/1009878306852777984			
	SoV = store of value (or wealth), MoWT = medium of wealth transfer, MoCE = medium of consumer exchange. This terminology is more illuminating, especially for cryptocurrency, than the traditional SoV/MoE distinction.

bitcoin 	The value of Bitcoin as SoV, MoWT, and in future via layer2 MoCE is indeed based on its strong & seamlessly global security vs. double-spending, censorship, etc. & prospects for better key management, not on merely economic measures like price and volatility (which will adapt).https://twitter.com/BIGbenStew/status/1009868186890752001 …	NickSzabo4	260	81	1529606876	1009870550741671936	https://twitter.com/NickSzabo4/status/1009870550741671936

bitcoin 	Gold was a medium of wealth transfer, not just an investment. Today Bitcoin is an OK long-term SoV (will improve as volatility declines) but a spectacular MoWT. Media of consumer exchange will come w/layer2s, but that's not more important than wealth storage & transfer.https://twitter.com/alonsovalenciav/status/1009846601685393408 …	NickSzabo4	744	215	1529605481	1009864700903841793	https://twitter.com/NickSzabo4/status/1009864700903841793
