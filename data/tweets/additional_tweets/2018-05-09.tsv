ethereum 	> And the 20% of coins that devs receive is a big no-no!! It's 10% of coins. Second, the premine is ~10% of coins in Ethereum too, so I'm not sure what credibility I had in your eyes in the first place.

	Ah sorry. I thought you were talking about the kind of stuff David Chaum talks about where the sender of a tx can collude with some authority to unmask the receiver, but no one else can do that.

	I don't trust ringsig stuff for confidentiality nearly as much as I do SNARKs. That's my considered opinion after researching and understanding the workings of both. I do trust ringsig stuff more for soundness. But for a privacy coin, confidentiality matters more than soundness.	VitalikButerin	8	1	1525883760	994254670460801024	https://twitter.com/VitalikButerin/status/994254670460801024			
	A compromise of the trusted setup affects Zcash's *survival*, not its *confidentiality*. If the trusted setup was done by the NSA, they could kill Zcash, but they could not deanonymize past transactions.

	And users specifically care about the coin maintaining confidentiality, not the coin surviving (outside of a window of a few hours).	VitalikButerin	31	3	1525883305	994252760970399745	https://twitter.com/VitalikButerin/status/994252760970399745			
	There is a BIG DIFFERENCE between (i) a privacy coin *surviving* for the long term and (ii) a privacy coin *maintaining my confidentiality* for the long term. The latter does not require the former. Zcash's confidentiality guarantees are stronger than its survival guarantees.	VitalikButerin	62	7	1525883232	994252455151009792	https://twitter.com/VitalikButerin/status/994252455151009792			
	You're conflating two kinds of temporary privacy: 1. It's secret now, comes out in 2 years 2. Right now I'm donating $1k to [controversial charity here], I want that specific tx not traced back to me I'm talking about (2).

	To expand/clarify: decentralization is important in ensuring a privacy coin survives in the long term. But if I have one transaction I really need to send privately *here and now*, then with the right cryptography centralized systems if available are totally sufficient.

	Ah perfect, thanks for clarifying. Some of your drivers believe you’re banned, but given what you say, I imagine that has more to do with the relationship with the taxistas than with the government... or my comprehension of Chilean Spanish has degraded considerably	cburniske	6	0	1525894441	994299468622200833	https://twitter.com/cburniske/status/994299468622200833

	. @ Uber is banned in Chile, but riders just sit in the front seat & claim to be a friend of the driver if stopped by the police (who are in cahoots w/ the taxistas). There are 60K drivers to meet the demand.
