	Indeed, it'd be much better if everyone contributed voluntarily. You'll note that my tweet doesn't suggest taxing the miners -- it laments that the amount given to the miners is far far in excess of what most miners do for the community.	el33th4xor	4	0	1526922389	998610997874253824	https://twitter.com/el33th4xor/status/998610997874253824

bitcoin 	300m+ guns in America. They would get passed around pretty fast if a fight started. And, yes, hillbilly ISIS is a vast and sprawling threat.

	Yes, it is. Look, the Warsaw Ghetto matters. That's why rifles: never again. Canada, Sweden, Switzerland. Gun ownership rates much like America's. Gun murder rates are like 15% of US levels.

	The sheer *numbers* do the talking. Tanks have supply chains. Aircraft are extremely vulnerable on runways. Cities are horrific combat environments.

	There is absolutely no doubt in anybody's mind that the US govement cannot win a war with the US citizenry. They're outnumbered 150 to 1, would face massive mutinies, could not protect things like grid and port infrastructure, and would likely lose physical custody of nukes.	leashless	1	0	1526937005	998672299581722624	https://twitter.com/leashless/status/998672299581722624			
	Of course they can win. The militias won in Iraq and Afghanistan, and there are 20 times as many of them in America with much better equipment. This is not complicated: the US govement cannot win a war against its own people. It could win a civil war with a divided population.	leashless	1	0	1526936902	998671868004585472	https://twitter.com/leashless/status/998671868004585472			
	"The failure of the US military in Iraq and Afghanistan and even Vietnam is a complete vindication of the ""tyrannical govement can be stopped by guns"" argument: indeed, it has been. Several times.

	You realize the US lost in Iraq and Afghanistan, right? Against lightly armed citizen militias with rifles and landmines. If they had zero guns in Iraq, they would have been mopped up in a weekend.

	Understand this clearly: your feeling that you're fit to critique on this *is white privilege*. You aren't enlightened.

	All you're doing is braying your spiritual ignorance. You can can't recognize enlightement unless it's packaged in exactly the milquetoast form you're teachers packaged it in.

	Well, shit is how it is. I don't understand there to be any metaphysical benefit to enlightement, any more than there is such a benefit from understanding orbital mechanics correctly.

	It’s entirely consistent. Don’t make foolish, ill-conceived threats that then lead to you backing down and losing credibility.

	At this point, US-China trade negotiations seem to be at a similar point as NAFTA: Trump has threatened, hasn’t gotten anything close to what he wanted, and is now forced to kick the (mostly empty) can down the road, while declaring minor nibbles around the edges “breakthroughs”.	prchovanec	25	5	1526906684	998545124689891328	https://twitter.com/prchovanec/status/998545124689891328
