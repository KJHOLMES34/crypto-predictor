	PoS (the sybil control mechanism) does not inherently require a compromise of censorship resistance -- quite the opposite. It's the unscalable consensus protocols that people couple up to PoS that limits them to a small (eg 21 in EOS) number of validators.	el33th4xor	2	0	1529815790	1010746798510571520	https://twitter.com/el33th4xor/status/1010746798510571520

	Law is as complex a system as humans can master.

	And what we are suggesting is that the blockchain ecosystem as a whole could pull in 10% of those costs - Mattereum is a player in that space, but one among many. We are supporting the transformation.	leashless	1	0	1529830852	1010809976393256960	https://twitter.com/leashless/status/1010809976393256960			
	Actually 10tr is a lowball estimate. Think of the whole mess with bills of lading, PDF invoices, and reconciliation of books at audit. That all can go. Mattereum doesn't do the whole process. We do some of the hardest bits, but (usually) in support of domain experts.	leashless	1	0	1529830757	1010809577514979328	https://twitter.com/leashless/status/1010809577514979328

	And, I should clarify, most of our role is to support the people building that transformation.

	You have to watch the long term equilibria at all points: where is the ball going to be in ten years? Skate there. The coin game is revolutionary, no doubt, but the tech game is inexorable.
