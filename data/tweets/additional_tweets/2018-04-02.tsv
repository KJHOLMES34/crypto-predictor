	Actually, even the internet at large is in many cases not that healthy. See: the media (both the outright crazies and the mainstream)	VitalikButerin	5	3	1522665219	980755131191799808	https://twitter.com/VitalikButerin/status/980755131191799808			
	We kinda do rank based on influence; it's called likes/retweets/upvotes. Problems: 1. Measure user count, which is an exploitable metric 2. Proprietary; should ideally be open and separated from platforms themselves 3. Often encourages bubble formation	VitalikButerin	6	2	1522665131	980754762005020672	https://twitter.com/VitalikButerin/status/980754762005020672			
	"We need to more actively encourage active community involvement especially in deciding economic parameters, which are legitimate tradeoffs between goals and not just a ""technocratic security setting"". The totally organic response to EIP 867 was encouraging; need even more of that"	VitalikButerin	30	3	1522664978	980754121782251520	https://twitter.com/VitalikButerin/status/980754121782251520			
	"1. People do broadly support fixed supply 2. Community has gone a long way from ""are the core devs up high going to make this happen or not?"" closer to ""I don't care about the source, I think it's a good idea"", but there's still a long way to go to get there."	VitalikButerin	29	3	1522664866	980753650388578304	https://twitter.com/VitalikButerin/status/980753650388578304			
bitcoin 	At least one could see how someone naively observing the last 3 years of US and global politics, as well as Bitcoin and other crypto communities, might find that believable. But I think we still have quite a lot to try before we need to resign ourselves to that conclusion.	VitalikButerin	8	5	1522664600	980752534368239618	https://twitter.com/VitalikButerin/status/980752534368239618			
	There is also the pessimistic hypothesis, that intellectual communities larger than ~1000 people are always attackable, so the only secure communities will be quasi-dictatorial and regular people will only be able to choose between them based on observable long-run performance.	VitalikButerin	9	3	1522664438	980751856862314501	https://twitter.com/VitalikButerin/status/980751856862314501			
	And long-run-inflationary tokens are a bad idea because of arguments in https://vitalik.ca/general/2017/10/17/moe.html … Crypto can avoid being too inegalitarian through emergence of new coins, not through any single coin being super-inflationary.	VitalikButerin	210	44	1522663299	980747076945379328	https://twitter.com/VitalikButerin/status/980747076945379328			
	I do now believe that fixed supply is worth considering. Arguments: * With ASICs, PoW issuance fails at making coin distribution more egalitarian * With PoS, PoW issuance not needed for security * With rewards coming from rent+other burned fees, can have rewards without issuance	VitalikButerin	367	89	1522663205	980746683481964545	https://twitter.com/VitalikButerin/status/980746683481964545			
ethereum 	And by the way, most people missed one of the more well-hidden jokes in https://blog.ethereum.org/2018/04/01/announcing-world-trade-francs-official-ethereum-stablecoin/ …: ~20% of the blogpost was plagiarized from https://tron.network/en.html	VitalikButerin	272	34	1522663003	980745838296092672	https://twitter.com/VitalikButerin/status/980745838296092672			
	If the community wants fixed supply and people believe that EIP 960 is a good way to achieve that, then it should adopt the proposal. If the community does not, then it should not. This is true regardless of whether or not the original intent was in jest.	VitalikButerin	157	29	1522662896	980745388691922945	https://twitter.com/VitalikButerin/status/980745388691922945			
	In reality, of course, it should not matter. The proposal is very real in the sense that the words actually were written in the github issue, and the arguments for it are real arguments.	VitalikButerin	92	15	1522662816	980745050941374464	https://twitter.com/VitalikButerin/status/980745050941374464			
ethereum 	"For those still wondering whether or not https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/960 … was an April Fool's joke, the answer is: it was an April Fool's meta-joke. *The point* was seeing people argue about whether or not the proposal is ""real""."

	Your previous tweets about 0-conf indicate that you belligerently don't understand the technical issues involved. I urge you to talk to a technical person who can help.

	For the last time: a successful double spend is any instance where someone fools a system to provide a service or good, without payment or with a payment that is reverted. You claim your exchange accepts 0-conf.

	The number of confirmations someone demands is up to them. In this quiz, it's just 2. You claim that your exchange demands 0.

	A central bank's authority over our financial future isn't earned and must be questioned.

	And corporations are subject to scrutiny to prove systemic bias and discrimination in the way they price insurance policies, where as individuals can be biased for years and never be revealed as racists.

	What you want is insurance, not identity. I can safely deal with anonymous people if I trust their insurers, and their insurers are corporate and are not entitled to anonymity as an individual human is. Bad people will wind up with high premiums, and very bad people uninsurable.	leashless	15	3	1522699476	980898815338147840	https://twitter.com/leashless/status/980898815338147840			
	Reputation systems provide UNLIMITED potential for harming out-groups. A very racist person could harm every Jew or Arab they dealt with for *years* before systematic bias could be proven.

	We are using reputation to try and make sure bad things never happen! But this is never going to work: accidents happen, and reputation does not protect us from that.

	What we want is not reputation, it's restorative justice. If somebody harms you, you will guaranteeably be made whole. If I present you with a proof that I am insured against bad conduct, and you trust my insurer will pay, REPUTATION is suddenly a whole bunch less important.	leashless	18	4	1522699150	980897448443785216	https://twitter.com/leashless/status/980897448443785216			
	Here's what you want: http://Identityinsurance.org  to anchor the identities, then some variant on @ InsurePal_io to guarantee good conduct.

	At that time (during Mao, prior to Deng) I don't think the US had even the pretension of influencing China domestically. It was purely a realpolitik geopolitical play.	prchovanec	0	0	1522625209	980587317197967361	https://twitter.com/prchovanec/status/980587317197967361			
	"So I'm a bit distrustful of these things in foreign policy that are so obvious and that ""everyone knows"" should have been done differently.

	This was actually the dominant view in the 1990s, and people would literally roll their eyes at you if you disagreed (as I did).	prchovanec	16	2	1522625018	980586517881085952	https://twitter.com/prchovanec/status/980586517881085952

	I'm old enough to distinctly remember when conventional wisdom was that President Bush Sr's decision not to advance to Baghdad and occupy Iraq was a woeful and obvious mistake, and responsible for leaving behind a big mess.	prchovanec	19	1	1522624910	980586061243060225	https://twitter.com/prchovanec/status/980586061243060225			
	Then there's the question what the viable alternatives were, at each point along the way, and whether they would have produced better outcomes.	prchovanec	19	3	1522624772	980585484228407297	https://twitter.com/prchovanec/status/980585484228407297			
	First there is the question of whether the outcomes are undesirable, which I'd argue is trickier that it might appear. Then there is the question of whether US policy (and which US policies) influenced this for the better, worse, or weren't really relevant oneway or the other.	prchovanec	19	3	1522624714	980585240329678850	https://twitter.com/prchovanec/status/980585240329678850

	I think it's been based on the idea of encouraging reforms, via such engagement, to the extent possible. And I think the results have been mixed.	prchovanec	4	1	1522624630	980584890419867648	https://twitter.com/prchovanec/status/980584890419867648			
	Moreover, it tries to ascribe all negative or problematic outcomes to US policy, as though the US were in a position to simply dictate what China's path would look like.	prchovanec	50	6	1522624428	980584039542394880	https://twitter.com/prchovanec/status/980584039542394880

	I think it's okay to have discussions with children about real issues. But debating them in this kind of atmosphere, and treating them as if they're just smaller adults, is wrong and irresponsible.

	That's a dumb comment. Whether you should argue politics with children has nothing to do with expertise and everything to do with value judgments. My values say: don't do this.
