	that's true, polls show a slight majority agreeing with Trump: https://yhoo.it/2H3KXib . but I believe it's possible to feel the same way he does re: respecting the flag AND think it's wrong for him to interfere/use the NFL as a political chip.	readDanwrite	0	0	1528201137	1003974452865052673	https://twitter.com/readDanwrite/status/1003974452865052673			
	I really don't think it is. I'm hardly the only one to note this. he has a proven, factual history of a vendetta against NFL-- a club he wanted to join but couldn't-- and now that he has the world's biggest megaphone, he's using it.	readDanwrite	0	0	1528200824	1003973141629194241	https://twitter.com/readDanwrite/status/1003973141629194241

	This won’t go away. why would he stop hitting it? nothing will change unless/until the NFL does the opposite of what it has done so far: tell Trump publicly and definitively that the league will be ignoring his further criticisms and edicts.

	Agreed that all those cases would be hard to distinguish. But many others would be easy.

	Agreed that reliability is hard. And there will be some cases where an algorithm is outperformed by humans with context who know that the food has been buttered or sugared. But in many other cases I’d expect machine vision to outperform a human (eg tossed salads).	balajis	3	0	1528182740	1003897292527624192	https://twitter.com/balajis/status/1003897292527624192			
	Yep. I think on balance though it’ll save time in terms of data entry. And will probably be more accurate than human in some cases, especially if it benefits from network effect of many photos. For example, Umami Burger’s fries could be differentiated from McDonald’s fries.	balajis	4	0	1528180810	1003889195625009152	https://twitter.com/balajis/status/1003889195625009152			
	Obviously, it can be defeated in some ways.

	Right. So you’d have to do portion sizing from the image or video. I think that is actually probably easier than the object recognition problem.

	Probably would need some heuristics, but I bet you could get very far with modern cameras and AI. Especially if you used video, you could estimate depth by prompting the user to rotate the camera around the food a bit.	balajis	6	2	1528179211	1003882491055259648	https://twitter.com/balajis/status/1003882491055259648			
	You could probably do it in realtime, too. Visualize AR nutrition info appearing over the food before you eat it. Would be useful for dieters. Might even help you know if there’s some recent health issue with the food, like a Salmonella outbreak or recall.	balajis	72	10	1528179102	1003882034647875584	https://twitter.com/balajis/status/1003882034647875584			
	It’s now technically possible to take a photo of any food and display the nutritional breakdown.

bitcoin 	Whereas with LN you can still send extremely cheap transactions for fractions of a sat even if # Bitcoin is at $1 million. So either 1) $ BCHers don't understand it or 2) they only care about making money and once their coin reaches a certain price they don't care about cheap txs.

	What I really don't understand about $ BCH: They're all about low fees, a simple transaction (1 input 2 output) is ~250 bytes. Let us assume all transactions are 1 sat/byte. At $10k per coin tx fee = $0.025, at $100k tx fee = $0.25, at $1 million tx fee = $2.5. Not cheap at all.

	hard to get the full trade idea explained in less than a minute on stage but this is how I set it up. First target was about 50% up, and I wanted atleast a 2:1 risk reward.

	Crushed today in TLT.. if this next part plays out.. THIS IS A BIG DEAL...

	I can't believe I am going to say this.. but I am getting the strong feeling that rates may have already topped for the year.. and if my DAY chart plays out exact in next 2-3 days.. IT HAS.. this means a lot to many other areas.. metals included..	Bamabroker	27	2	1528165995	1003827057992912898	https://twitter.com/Bamabroker/status/1003827057992912898			
	Bonds.. WELL this is where we see just how good I am .. I have just crushed bonds all year.. crushed.. but If I hit this week.. this is a BIG deal... I am not going to get into why yet.. but the next 2-3 days is VERY big for rates..	Bamabroker	13	1	1528165920	1003826741654278144	https://twitter.com/Bamabroker/status/1003826741654278144			
	Like to see SPX spike to 2772 soon.. that should be enough for a short term pullback.. SPX down 20 after that.. back to 2750s.. SPX bears claim monster top is in.. collect more shorts in SPX.. and SPX isn't bullish till 2772 breaks is trending.. Sets up 2800 in 7 days later	Bamabroker	17	2	1528165843	1003826420991381506	https://twitter.com/Bamabroker/status/1003826420991381506
