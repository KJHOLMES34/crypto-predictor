	I'm running a full node right now, so I know exactly how difficult it is.

	Which remote node though? IMO for most people this would basically amount to connecting to a third-party-controlled centralized server.	VitalikButerin	16	3	1529760085	1010513155817201665	https://twitter.com/VitalikButerin/status/1010513155817201665

	With stateless verification, more possibilities appear. For example, a light node that fully verifies specific blocks in order of total quantity of deposited stake held by nodes that submit alert messages about that block, running the verification process only when charging/ed.

	Another possibility is a light node that has a trailing full-node verification process that only runs when the laptop or phone is charging (or even fully charged and still plugged in).

	Wishlist: a blockchain node that only syncs when either (i) the app was used in the last N minutes or (ii) the laptop/phone's battery is charging. Would substantially improve the user experience of using a partially or fully verifying node for one's day-to-day transacting.

	OG’s compare this correction to the bear market of 2013/14.The difference; In 2014 the mkt went from $12bn back to $3bn wiping out $9bn from a bunch of geeks that paid close to zero for their mined coins! This crash wiped $600bn from people that had no idea what they were buying.	cryptomanran	621	128	1529724324	1010363165505400832	https://twitter.com/cryptomanran/status/1010363165505400832

	I don’t care who you are or whether you bought in $50/$5000/$18000, the decline from $20k to $6k hurt everyone.

bitcoin 	"I've been educating the public on what Bitcoin *actually* is for the past 18 months. If they haven't listened to any of that, it's on them.

bitcoin 	Bitcoin is a long term investment. It takes courage, conviction, patience, wisdom and virtue to get through these bear markets. The people that don't understand the long term value will get out regardless of whether I'm welcoming or not. Fairness has nothing to do with it.	jimmysong	269	36	1529726163	1010370874925637632	https://twitter.com/jimmysong/status/1010370874925637632			
	Bear markets are great because we get rid of those that don't understand the tech and were just gambling. I hold because I believe in the technology and the economics. Go away until you have some conviction. Don't let the door hit you on the way out.	jimmysong	3005	770	1529724403	1010363494888361984	https://twitter.com/jimmysong/status/1010363494888361984			
	This is the mentality of someone who hasn't been through a bubble before. I'm used to this and the more you get used to 70-90% drops, the better off you'll be. In other words, I disagree.

	The current Brexit mess is caused by the drive towards the hardest possible Brexit despite such a close referendum result.

	Industrial and banks basicly going straight down now. New 2018 lows are days away. Both are horrible. Utes and staples likely pass them next week. For YTD performance.
