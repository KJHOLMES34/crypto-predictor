	I personally don't think that this is the best reason - centralized currencies can also NOT inflate. Remember, a central system, that people trust, will always be more efficient (faster, cheaper, scalable) than a decentralized system.https://twitter.com/realcoincentral/status/1007988472559398914 …	julianhosp	15	1	1529262453	1008425934670659584	https://twitter.com/julianhosp/status/1008425934670659584

	In over 9 years since its creation, the $ BTC # blockchain has never been offline, there was never any outage and there is no known example of # censorship. This is, what a true # blockchain should look like. Any real blockchain should be that way - else it is a central # database!	julianhosp	227	59	1529250982	1008377823877320704	https://twitter.com/julianhosp/status/1008377823877320704		# # # #	
	Don't use a blockchain, if you don't want to be decentralized. For efficiency, speed and scalability, use a centralized database and you will do a lot better.https://twitter.com/Xentagz/status/1008097814088429574 …	julianhosp	42	9	1529237033	1008319317065256960	https://twitter.com/julianhosp/status/1008319317065256960

	I’m an immigration hawk. My family came here legally, and assimilated into a society that didn’t want them, through hard, backbreaking work. I cry no tears for illegal immigrants.

	I don’t like Trump-Nazi comparisons, and sure, @ GenMhayden is taking static for that. But when the USG is acting on the advice of an angry, creepy little boy like Stephen Miller to separate children from parents as a political tool, those comparisons make a lot more sense.
