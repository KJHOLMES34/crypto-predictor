	"All in all, I can see heavy de-facto ""libertarian paternalist"" soft censorship existing a few decades from now, coming from two angles: * Corporate filtering (additive) * Government filtering with partial enforcement and VPNs (subtractive)"	VitalikButerin	11	5	1523437403	983993907192221698	https://twitter.com/VitalikButerin/status/983993907192221698			
	As in, the impulses that lead to newfangled internet tribes acting like nation states will not be liberal ones; the structural liberalism will come from ease of temporarily opting out.	VitalikButerin	7	3	1523436801	983991380564471808	https://twitter.com/VitalikButerin/status/983991380564471808			
	On second thought this is interesting. Post-Westphalianism of the internet variety is certainly more liberal than nation state primacy *structurally*, but there's nothing that necessarily makes it that way *ideologically*	VitalikButerin	12	3	1523436638	983990697563971584	https://twitter.com/VitalikButerin/status/983990697563971584

	"> Indeed the process of changing your mind and switching to the majority to ensure the network converges is the point of the consensus system The whole point of casper FFG is to allow changing your mind in ""legitimate"" ways but not ""illegitimate"" ways.

	Prediction - After the next financial crisis we will see a ‘Blockchain’ fiat bailout airdrop to replace bank deposits from the bank they let blow up.

	We are without a doubt in the bottom of the 9th inning on the news cycle. I don't recall a market that ignored businsss and only focused on Macro news like this since the 2008 lows and 2011 lows.

	You do an amazing job on day trading pivots but I don't think you have a higher or lower oil call. More about what you see next 75c based on your system.	Bamabroker	6	0	1523413346	983893001373134848	https://twitter.com/Bamabroker/status/983893001373134848			
	We could easy see 55 down the road again. Even though I think we are going to rally to 68 now. But your not making calls for next 3 weeks so not sure you should be calling them out. You go back and forth every day based on your pivots.	Bamabroker	8	0	1523413283	983892737383714816	https://twitter.com/Bamabroker/status/983892737383714816			
	Not trying to be rude PK. But I am bullish oil but to answer your question depends on time. Oil is has done nothing for 3 months and I have seen you bullish and bearish 30 times since then.	Bamabroker	5	0	1523413188	983892340665409536	https://twitter.com/Bamabroker/status/983892340665409536
