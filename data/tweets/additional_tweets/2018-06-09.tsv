	(1) and (2) are obviously useful to some extent but ultimately insufficient and kinda lame (for scaling that is; obviously we need many separate chains for experimentation and ecosystem diversity). (3) is arguably underrated. (4) and (5) can give the biggest gains.	VitalikButerin	59	18	1528537550	1005385470912561153	https://twitter.com/VitalikButerin/status/1005385470912561153			
	My view: there are basically 5 scaling strategies: 1. Many separate chains 2. Super-big blocks 3. Incremental improvements that don't change security model (eg. replacing txs + sigs with compressed delta + STARKs) 4. Layer 2 (channels and plasma) 5. Sharding	VitalikButerin	929	383	1528537317	1005384496311496704	https://twitter.com/VitalikButerin/status/1005384496311496704			
	I think it's important to distinguish the case where data is intended to be made public, and the case where data is intended to be shared among a limited group. In the former case, you're mainly aiming for availability; the latter case is more complicated (and more important!)

bitcoin 	Hashrate is tied to *exponential* leaps in computational abilities that satisfy human’s involuntary, evolutionary path vs. (relatively) *linear* demand for money, so hashrate (via collective unconscious) is driving # Bitcoin price, and not the other way around.	maxkeiser	19	9	1528552751	1005449228301324289	https://twitter.com/maxkeiser/status/1005449228301324289		#

No exit!!	officialmcafee	2202	564	1528559278	1005476604821241858	https://twitter.com/officialmcafee/status/1005476604821241858

ripple 	My point is mostly that anyone can create a coin, but not everyone can create value. People think Ripple just “printed” those XRP, unfairly creating money. It’s not unfair if everyone has this option. I created 10 trillion $ FORK tokens after reading a blog.

	Love is not something you accumulate (that's more like glory or fame). Love is something you do. And love certainly creates lots of vlaue so it's an ability worth learning.	jimmysong	21	0	1528567270	1005510128014123008	https://twitter.com/jimmysong/status/1005510128014123008			
	There are two types of things to accumulate in life: Abilities to create value. Scarce things to store value.	jimmysong	1205	350	1528566879	1005508488108347393	https://twitter.com/jimmysong/status/1005508488108347393			
	Competence in one sphere does not necessarily translate to competence in another. Hubris is thinking this applies to others, but not to you.	jimmysong	246	49	1528553414	1005452010177560582	https://twitter.com/jimmysong/status/1005452010177560582			
	Also, MtG is printed in a lot of languages and very popular over its 24 year history. I'm guessing some number between $10B-$100B if you include all the foreign editions.	jimmysong	13	1	1528498273	1005220733604237312	https://twitter.com/jimmysong/status/1005220733604237312			
	A couple things I found. 4th edition alone had a 500 million card run. $0.20/card (very low estimate), is still $100M. That's just a single set out of many. Most print runs were bigger, so I'm guessing it's well north of $1B. I'm guessing $10B is probably within reach.	jimmysong	15	1	1528498192	1005220391810314240	https://twitter.com/jimmysong/status/1005220391810314240			
	I'm guessing if a tweet contains a particular coin name, then it gets shadow-banned. This is something that may be an auto-generated rule based on known spam accounts.	jimmysong	9	1	1528497746	1005218524372045825	https://twitter.com/jimmysong/status/1005218524372045825
