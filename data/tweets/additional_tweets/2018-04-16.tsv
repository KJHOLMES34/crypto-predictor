	Agree. My point is simply that economies of scale are lowered by the scheme, regardless of what they are in absolute terms.	VitalikButerin	5	3	1523907565	985965906487595008	https://twitter.com/VitalikButerin/status/985965906487595008			
	IMO one key reason why decentralized software UX sucks ia simply lack of funding; foundation grants can mitigate some of that. That said, I do agree we need to prepare for a world where centralized pools dominate.

	Also, the fact that a big pool would need to spend 4x on mixed infrastructure to reduce its risk profile to be more similar to small pools counteracts economies of scale, which is itself a victory for decentralization.

	If it incentivized centralized pools to use mixed strategies, that by itself is a desired effect. The reason holders would still want smaller pools is the same reason users want decentralization: common mode failure risk involving the operator.

	Complaining about the lack of civility is about as effective as a kid whining about the lack of candy for dinner. Civility is an emergent property, not something forced on people.	jimmysong	255	39	1523902918	985946417578500096	https://twitter.com/jimmysong/status/985946417578500096			
	Fair criticism. I would argue that they have priced in negative externalities a lot more over time, so it's certainly going in the right direction.	jimmysong	8	0	1523897516	985923757444358144	https://twitter.com/jimmysong/status/985923757444358144			
bitcoin 	Yep, Bitcoin will take power from where it's cheapest. I'm not sure why that's a bad thing. Prices have embedded in it all the costs. If the negative externalities are too $$$, that, too, will get priced in eventually.	jimmysong	35	2	1523896742	985920511304785926	https://twitter.com/jimmysong/status/985920511304785926

	9/ This is one of the best parts of being in this community. We get to find out questions to macro-economic questions that have been debated a long time. /fin	jimmysong	134	10	1523844981	985703412858851328	https://twitter.com/jimmysong/status/985703412858851328			
	8/ They are very much alternatives for people that want a different economic system. How will competition affect things, if, say, each coin had a different set of economic axioms to start with?	jimmysong	55	3	1523844933	985703210630504450	https://twitter.com/jimmysong/status/985703210630504450			
	7/ When will economic reality force such people to adopt something they really don't like? I'm honestly curious. It's easy to say they'll be hypocrites and switch quickly, but I'm not so sure. Perhaps that's why ICOs and altcoins continue to have value.	jimmysong	63	3	1523844854	985702879754407938	https://twitter.com/jimmysong/status/985702879754407938			
bitcoin 	6/ Which brings up the question, are people willing to forego monetary gains to keep their beliefs? If so, Bitcoin adoption may take longer than I thought. There may be a minority that simply refuse to use it on principle.	jimmysong	84	4	1523844756	985702466946781185	https://twitter.com/jimmysong/status/985702466946781185			
	5/ The political view, in other words, is stopping people from participating in what would otherwise be economic curiosity. This may be a case where your politics literally costs you money.	jimmysong	56	5	1523844657	985702051312275457	https://twitter.com/jimmysong/status/985702051312275457			
ethereum 	"4/ Ethereum, for example, looks a lot more Monetarist, leaving the question of future supply unknown. They don't even call their stuff ""money"" but more ""oil"", implying that it's supposed to be used in computation."	jimmysong	76	4	1523844540	985701562466164736	https://twitter.com/jimmysong/status/985701562466164736			
bitcoin 	3/ I suspect this is also why many simply don't like Bitcoin. Not because they don't think it'll work, but because they don't *want* it to work. That would invalidate the world view that they have.	jimmysong	168	24	1523844381	985700894808436737	https://twitter.com/jimmysong/status/985700894808436737			
bitcoin 	2/ Instead, many want to try a different economic system with less stringent rules than Bitcoin. Such as a benevolent king that decides on the money supply.	jimmysong	93	10	1523844326	985700665962921985	https://twitter.com/jimmysong/status/985700665962921985			
bitcoin 	1/ Other than enriching their founders, I suspect the biggest reason for creation of altcoins and ICOs is that many don't like the economics behind Bitcoin. That is, they disagree with the Austrian view of sound money.	jimmysong	407	113	1523844235	985700283262087173	https://twitter.com/jimmysong/status/985700283262087173

	The effective Fed Funds rate was raised 2 times (50 bps) under Obama, and now four times (100 bps) under Trump. But we're at a very different stage in the business cycle now.
