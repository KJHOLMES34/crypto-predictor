In other words, removing US troop presence - simply in return from promise of DPRK denuclearization - could open a serious void in the balance of power in North Asia that could prove even more destabilizing than a nuclear-amred North Korea.	prchovanec	10	5	1527470471	1000909820793360384	https://twitter.com/prchovanec/status/1000909820793360384

	I find it interesting that a number of Trump supporters are taking Farrakhan's comment that Trump is destroying their common enemies - the American institutions he hates - as something to celebrate, rather than occasion for self-reflection.https://www.americanthinker.com/blog/2018/05/louis_farrakhan_mr_trump_is_destroying_every_enemy_that_was_an_enemy_of_our_rise.html …	prchovanec	43	11	1527469530	1000905871508033536	https://twitter.com/prchovanec/status/1000905871508033536
