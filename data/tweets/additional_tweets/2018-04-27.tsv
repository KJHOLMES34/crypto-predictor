	The point is that this is what I as a member of the public intuitively expect, and I view the fact that journalistic standards apparently say otherwise as being morally tantamount to Zuckerberg's various personal data terms of service traps.

	British imperial wealth was built by her colonial subjects. The empire has collapsed and the children of these colonial subjects have the right to immigrate. UK is tiny compared to her empire; we see that in the immigration patterns.

	People in traditional finance have no understanding what free market finance actually looks like. Their monetary unit itself is centrally planned and controlled by government.	ErikVoorhees	112	14	1524861665	989967694932856832	https://twitter.com/ErikVoorhees/status/989967694932856832			
	Yes with three important exceptions: 1) there is no private group of gatekeepers that control it (open source), 2) it is global and borderless, and 3) there is a limit to the money supply and its quantity is always perfectly known.

	Hmmmm... perhaps you guys are forgetting that as we got closer to the HF date, and it became increasingly clear that the majority consensus was not around the SegWit2x fork, myself and others backed out and called it off.

bitcoin 	"I don't hate BCH at all. I'm fine with one or many chains existing as long as they aren't portrayed inaccurately. I don't think it's legitimate to call BCH ""Bitcoin"" and to use my statements out of context to imply support."

ripple 	The Segwit part of SegWit2x happened, but the 2x part did not. Regardless, I supported it. Roger did not support SegWit2x, and was fully on board with BCH since its inception. And ShapeShift offers lots of coins for sale, that doesn't mean I personally endorse them (...Ripple)	ErikVoorhees	228	13	1524791508	989673434266222592	https://twitter.com/ErikVoorhees/status/989673434266222592			
	I said I would support a HF (which I did with the Segwit2x proposal). I have never stated any support whatsoever for the BCH fork. Roger is misconstruing my statement to imply support of BCH, which is clearly working since people like you fall for it.

bitcoin 	Roger - please stop referencing me to back up your opinion that Bitcoin Cash is Bitcoin. It isn't. Bitcoin is the chain originating from the genesis block with the highest accumulated proof of work. The Bitcoin Cash fork failed to gain majority, thus it is not Bitcoin.

	Sony's results made it clear that sales momentum of PlayStation 4 peaked out. But it's in the middle of the harvesting season and expects to profit a lot from software and network services. No comment at all about next-generation PlayStation hardware.https://www.wsj.com/articles/sony-posts-record-operating-profit-1524825705 …	mochi_wsj	17	6	1524828557	989828827105800193	https://twitter.com/mochi_wsj/status/989828827105800193			
	4月1日に就任して以来、初めてCFOとして決算説明会に臨んだソニーの十時さん。前任で現社長の吉田さんにも増してゆっくりで丁寧な説明が印象的でした。吉田さんとはソネット時代に一緒に組んでいた仲。注目の中期経営計画は来月下旬に発表予定です。 https://www.wsj.com/articles/sony-posts-record-operating-profit-1524825705 …	mochi_wsj	4	3	1524828411	989828214439624705	https://twitter.com/mochi_wsj/status/989828214439624705			
	一方苦しいのがスマホ事業。説明会では撤退の可能性について質問が来ることを予想してから質疑応答に入る前に5Gの時代が来たときの為にスマホ事業を通して技術を培う意義の説明がなされました。ただ、赤字はいけないので安定的に黒字にできるようにする、とは十時さん。https://www.wsj.com/articles/sony-posts-record-operating-profit-1524825705 …	mochi_wsj	6	5	1524827885	989826011171667968	https://twitter.com/mochi_wsj/status/989826011171667968			
	ソニーはFGOやマギレコなど、アニプレックスが手掛けるスマホゲームからの営業利益が400億円弱になったと発表しました。金額ベースで前年度から倍になり、また17年度の音楽分野における営業利益額の3割にあたります。 https://www.wsj.com/articles/sony-posts-record-operating-profit-1524825705 …	mochi_wsj	24	28	1524827485	989824330220498944	https://twitter.com/mochi_wsj/status/989824330220498944			
	ソニーの決算ではPS4普及速度のピークアウトが鮮明になりつつも、PSPlusやダウンロード版ソフトの拡販により利益幅が拡大したことが確認できました。十時CFOも「PS4の収穫期をできるだけ伸ばしたい」とコメント。一方PlayStationの次世代機については一切の言及を避けました。 https://www.wsj.com/articles/sony-posts-record-operating-profit-1524825705 …	mochi_wsj	14	19	1524827273	989823444941328384	https://twitter.com/mochi_wsj/status/989823444941328384

	PS - so why is Moon praising Trump for achieving peace, saving the Olympics, etc etc? Quite simply because you can catch more flies with honey than vinegar. It’s his best chance of keeping Trump on-side.	prchovanec	370	61	1524848528	989912592775876613	https://twitter.com/prchovanec/status/989912592775876613

	Obviously!	prchovanec	0	0	1524848186	989911160190365696	https://twitter.com/prchovanec/status/989911160190365696			
	30. As I’ve indicated, I think it’s a lot more complicated than that, and the US faces some major risks ahead, with potentially lasting consequences for its position in Asia and the world.	prchovanec	179	33	1524848136	989910949233680385	https://twitter.com/prchovanec/status/989910949233680385			
	29. Trump, meanwhile, is convinced that he is genius on the verge of making history, that his sanctions and threats have brought Kim scurrying to the bargaining table. And his domestic supporters are thrilled at what they see as a historic accomplishment.	prchovanec	189	41	1524847979	989910288395882496	https://twitter.com/prchovanec/status/989910288395882496			
	28. Abe, faced with a corruption scandal at home, is just hanging on for the ride. He knows Japan has been sidelined but can’t do much for the moment. But Japan will be forced to recalculate where its interests lie over the longer term.	prchovanec	121	20	1524847850	989909751231369217	https://twitter.com/prchovanec/status/989909751231369217			
	27. China, which was starting to see Kim as a liability, sees the same opportunity and now views Kim - for the moment at least - as an asset again.	prchovanec	127	23	1524847738	989909278810099713	https://twitter.com/prchovanec/status/989909278810099713			
	26. Given Trump’s ambivalence towards traditional US alliances, Kim sees as chance to achieve long-held goals (including US troop withdrawal) with much less resistance than he ever dreamed.	prchovanec	161	43	1524847678	989909026455638022	https://twitter.com/prchovanec/status/989909026455638022			
	25. Kim, under pressure from US-led sanctions and an annoyed China, sees an out. It sees Moon’s olive branch as both a wedge it can drive open further and as a chance to find out what return it can finally get for its nuclear investment.	prchovanec	151	34	1524847532	989908413323841538	https://twitter.com/prchovanec/status/989908413323841538			
	24. South Korea (really Moon) fears US (really Trump) will pursue its own interests without regard for South Korea, and is looking to head him off with a peace initiative.	prchovanec	240	50	1524847173	989906911351984129	https://twitter.com/prchovanec/status/989906911351984129			
	23. My guesses are as follows:	prchovanec	66	9	1524847017	989906256755388417	https://twitter.com/prchovanec/status/989906256755388417			
	22. Obliviously there are a lot of different agendas playing out, and very much in competition with one another.	prchovanec	84	11	1524846982	989906107941482499	https://twitter.com/prchovanec/status/989906107941482499			
	21. And then the Moon-Kim summit yesterday. Lots of symbolism and heightened expectations, unclear what it all means.	prchovanec	99	10	1524846926	989905875325407232	https://twitter.com/prchovanec/status/989905875325407232			
	20. Kim goes to Beijing, for first time, and has a surprisingly chummy meeting with Xi Jinping. Xi agreed to come visit him in North Korea.	prchovanec	96	12	1524846880	989905682072850433	https://twitter.com/prchovanec/status/989905682072850433			
	19. Meanwhile, Kim commits to very little. Says he’s suspending nuclear and missile testing, because they’ve achieved a credible deterrent (true or not). Leaves door open to vague “denuclearization” but on what terms? Won’t say what he wants in return.	prchovanec	134	23	1524846826	989905452422062080	https://twitter.com/prchovanec/status/989905452422062080			
	18. Two of North Korea’s biggest asks, over the years, have been a one-on-one meeting with US President, and a peace treaty, which could set the stage for US troops withdrawal. Now it looks like both could be happening.	prchovanec	136	39	1524846667	989904787792695296	https://twitter.com/prchovanec/status/989904787792695296			
	17. Moon also pushes the narrative that peace treaty could be imminent, between North and South. Says Kim might give up nukes in exchange for “security guarantees” from US.	prchovanec	87	8	1524846576	989904406324895745	https://twitter.com/prchovanec/status/989904406324895745			
	16. Even Kim’s invitation to Trump, for a one-on-one summit, comes via Moon, quite possibly at Moon’s instigation. Trump, with paramount confidence in his own negotiating skills, immediately agrees - without bothering to consult Abe.	prchovanec	134	17	1524846455	989903896205283328	https://twitter.com/prchovanec/status/989903896205283328			
	15. But Kim’s charm offensive is aimed at Moon, not Trump. At the Olympics, the US seems to be standing in the corner, folding its arms, as the North-South rapproachement gathers steam.	prchovanec	167	21	1524846331	989903377998983168	https://twitter.com/prchovanec/status/989903377998983168			
	14. Enter the Winter Olympics. Kim, under growing sanctions pressure, decides to turn on the charm. The world, alarmed at the prospect of impending conflict, breathes a sigh of relief.	prchovanec	92	10	1524846044	989902176142200833	https://twitter.com/prchovanec/status/989902176142200833			
	13. But then Trump turns his focus on trade disputes with China. Whatever the merits of those disputes, Xi wonders what his cooperation on Korea is actually getting him, and thinks about what leverage he can bring to bear on Trump.	prchovanec	97	13	1524845947	989901768384499712	https://twitter.com/prchovanec/status/989901768384499712			
	12. Meanwhile, Trump is pushing tougher sanctions on North Korea, with China’s apparent cooperation. Xi was already fed up with Kim, and seems willing to play along.	prchovanec	96	12	1524845855	989901380289785859	https://twitter.com/prchovanec/status/989901380289785859			
	11. He has a friendly relationship with Japan’s Abe on the surface, but undercuts him on TPP and steel tariffs.	prchovanec	114	12	1524845739	989900894648102912	https://twitter.com/prchovanec/status/989900894648102912			
	10. Meanwhile, Trump continues to berate South Korea over not paying the US enough for THAAD and other defense commitments, as well as over their “unfair” free trade agreement with the US.	prchovanec	98	15	1524845630	989900438685278208	https://twitter.com/prchovanec/status/989900438685278208			
	9. Trump then proceeds to trade insults and threats with Kim, and float proposals for a first strike on North Korea, without giving much indication that the potential impact on South Korea is any of his concern.	prchovanec	129	14	1524845550	989900101039677443	https://twitter.com/prchovanec/status/989900101039677443			
	8. Enter Trump, who openly questioned exactly this premise during the campaign, questioning whether US alliances with either country is worth what they cost us, and suggesting maybe they should look after themselves (with nukes of their own).	prchovanec	110	12	1524845387	989899419050012673	https://twitter.com/prchovanec/status/989899419050012673			
	7. Japan and South Korea have to ask, in a way they never had to before, whether US perceptions of its own security coincide with, or possibly compete with, their own.	prchovanec	166	28	1524845259	989898883244396545	https://twitter.com/prchovanec/status/989898883244396545			
	6. This poses a direct threat to the US itself that claims priority over, and potentially undermines, its regional commitments and interests in Asia.	prchovanec	95	10	1524845144	989898397799911429	https://twitter.com/prchovanec/status/989898397799911429			
	5. Second, North Korea finally appears to have achieved, or at least be on the cusp of, its longtime FIA of having a nuclear arsenal capable of hitting the US itself, not just South Korea or Japan.	prchovanec	107	14	1524844969	989897665503809538	https://twitter.com/prchovanec/status/989897665503809538			
	4. I’m not saying this is a universal view in South Korea - far from it. But it is back in the saddle again for the first time since President Roh’s “Sunshine Policy” a decade ago.	prchovanec	109	11	1524844824	989897058244087808	https://twitter.com/prchovanec/status/989897058244087808			
	3. Moon belongs to a party that has always felt, in its heart of hearts, that the two Koreas could work out their differences if it wasn’t for bigger powers (including the US) standing in the way.	prchovanec	171	34	1524844720	989896619335340032	https://twitter.com/prchovanec/status/989896619335340032			
	2. First of all, start with the impeachment and removal of South Korean President Park and her replacement by President Moon.	prchovanec	126	13	1524844660	989896370495676418	https://twitter.com/prchovanec/status/989896370495676418			
	1. What do I think is really going on in Korea? I’ll try to offer some thoughts.	prchovanec	1003	661	1524844555	989895930727026689	https://twitter.com/prchovanec/status/989895930727026689			
	Forget Trump. I would be more concerned than most of you by what I see playing out in Korea even if he weren’t part of the equation.	prchovanec	9	1	1524844021	989893690272440330	https://twitter.com/prchovanec/status/989893690272440330

	People saying I’m reluctant to give Trump credit for peace breaking out in Korea. What peace, exactly? I hear words, and see symbols, that could be put to many different uses. What I haven’t seen is any substantive change in how North Korea is ruled, or the threat it poses.	prchovanec	28	13	1524843794	989892737255247872	https://twitter.com/prchovanec/status/989892737255247872

	The main problem for US GDP in Q4 was a widening trade deficit. The main problem in Q1 was a slowdown in consumption growth. Housing keeps getting stuck in low gear.

	The personal savings rate was 3.1% in 1Q18, up from 2.6% in 4Q17. Despite the highest consumer confidence numbers in over a decade, consumers have been playing things a bit more cautiously so far this year.	prchovanec	3	1	1524835449	989857734756618241	https://twitter.com/prchovanec/status/989857734756618241

	Both exports and imports cooled down a bit from Q4. Exports grew by +4.8%, vs +7.0% in Q4. Imports grew by +2.6%, vs +14.1% surge in Q4.

	Fed updated their balance sheet this AM. Look at a 4 week chart of spx. Per the fed they stArted selling mortgage backs. 15B sold starting 4-19 am for next 4 days.
