	I've been trying to get an answer to that for weeks. I don't think there is a good answer. Most people misunderstand 51% attacks and think that it will cause hashrate to go up when coin is under attack. In reality, attack must be done in private and only released if successful.

bitcoin litecoin 	If 75% of LTC hashrate disappears, Litecoin will be as slow as Bitcoin (10 mins blocks) for 2 weeks. No big deal. And that's not going to happen to Litecoin unlike smaller coins where hashrate will disappear to mine other coins due to price fluctuations.

litecoin 	Please link to an explanation on why you need 93% of one algorithm? When the attack is done in secret, there is nothing the network can do to respond to. Also, Litecoin diff adjustment is 3.5 days. It could easily handle a diff drop. The fix is only need for smaller coins.

	What happens after “inflation funding” runs out is something the community as a whole needs to do more research on. Many people brush the question off with, “The market will figure it out.” That’s true, but the market doesn’t always take care of things in the way we’d like.	cburniske	36	3	1528408166	1004842796925235201	https://twitter.com/cburniske/status/1004842796925235201
