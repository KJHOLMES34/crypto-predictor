	"What kind of a category is ""Vitalik and Romanians""? I personally am impressed by Jeff Coleman and Japanese people."	VitalikButerin	47	5	1525367370	992088774380154880	https://twitter.com/VitalikButerin/status/992088774380154880			
	Even Wikipedia. I for one am a strong *opponent* of their strange unwillingness not to allow a single ad on the left side of the page; the frequent donation requests are much more annoying.	VitalikButerin	4	2	1525363399	992072119524712448	https://twitter.com/VitalikButerin/status/992072119524712448			
	"If advertising income was not available, there would be waaaaaaay more paywalls, and they would not be circumventable as easily as hitting ""view in an incognito window""."	VitalikButerin	5	2	1525363316	992071771867303937	https://twitter.com/VitalikButerin/status/992071771867303937			
	All of the above is not to deny the very real issues with advertising that people have been pointing out. I just hope that if there is a big social movement against it, we create an alternative that doesn't accidentally destroy the internet's present accessibility in the process.	VitalikButerin	203	19	1525363241	992071457139195904	https://twitter.com/VitalikButerin/status/992071457139195904			
	"""You can either pay $ x and just see the content or otherwise you have to look at ads"" seems like an attractive compromise, but is risky due to adverse selection: the people who can afford to pay $ x are precisely the demographic that advertisers care most about in the first place."	VitalikButerin	194	22	1525363166	992071140356042752	https://twitter.com/VitalikButerin/status/992071140356042752			
	Furthermore, payment introduces friction, especially because payment systems are not globally universal; if you don't have a credit card because you're unbanked, you're screwed.	VitalikButerin	73	12	1525363053	992070665594384389	https://twitter.com/VitalikButerin/status/992070665594384389			
	With simple payment-for-content, you have to set a price $ x, and (usually wealthier) people who can afford it will pay, and those who can't are stuck (or go to http://thepiratebay.org  or http://sci-hub.tw , but that's another subject...)	VitalikButerin	68	12	1525362995	992070422882607104	https://twitter.com/VitalikButerin/status/992070422882607104			
	That is, if you earn 2x more, annoyance is 2x more costly for you relative to money, and advertisers get 2x more dollars from the possibility that their ads will cause you to buy their products.	VitalikButerin	59	12	1525362853	992069828826615814	https://twitter.com/VitalikButerin/status/992069828826615814			
	The reason is that advertising accomplishes near-perfect price discrimination. Viewers are paying with annoyance of watching ads, and creators are paid by advertisers who are in turn paid by viewers who become product buyers; both are roughly proportional to the viewer's income.	VitalikButerin	107	16	1525362754	992069411581374464	https://twitter.com/VitalikButerin/status/992069411581374464			
	Advertising is what has allowed most internet content to be free, which massively improved accessibility; even the poorest people today, in many cases, have access to the same content and info as billionaires and kings.

	Though advertising has serious issues, as @ MihaiAlisie points out, I think it's also important to remember the good that advertising has done for us.pic.twitter.com/ArIk2b0cWk	VitalikButerin	423	115	1525362569	992068638982238208	https://twitter.com/VitalikButerin/status/992068638982238208			@

	Blue is the main chain, yellow is the beacon chain, red is shard chains, green is cross-links between chains (which establish a fixed relationship between individual blocks so there's consensus on how to handle any cross-shard stuff).

	I know maximalists love to act like prosecuted people, deeply wronged and outcast by society. And they probably are. It seems deeply ingrained in their psyche.

	Is a tweet from 2013 the best you've got? It was prudent advice on the face of bad news. One can always buy back into an investment.

	Yes, it's cynical. But I assume that massive huffing of cynicism and hypocrisy is now the only way conservatives who've supported Trump, or even those who tried to make their peace with Trump and avoid the # NeverTrump tag, can get out of bed in the morning at this point. /8x	RadioFreeTom	142	17	1525316393	991874961777283072	https://twitter.com/RadioFreeTom/status/991874961777283072		#	
	"This, of course, is a no-risk play. If Trump goes down, you can tell Rube America that you did your part against the Deep State. If Trump survives, you can say ""We were there with you, Mr. President, but we're still your honest critics."" Either way, Mueller will Mueller. /7"	RadioFreeTom	82	13	1525316393	991874960317734912	https://twitter.com/RadioFreeTom/status/991874960317734912			
	"Thus, when everything falls apart, you'll later be able to point to your moment on TV when you attacked Mueller, so you can say: ""Hey, we were fair to the President! We stuck up for him! We were even-handed! We criticized him, but also defended him!"" /6"	RadioFreeTom	55	4	1525316393	991874959390789632	https://twitter.com/RadioFreeTom/status/991874959390789632			
	The smart play, then, is start attacking Mueller *now*, knowing full well that there's not a prayer that any of this can be stopped at this point. It's cynical, but it's the time to say: I can look like I gave Trump a fair shake, knowing that the train will hit him anyway. /5	RadioFreeTom	71	10	1525316392	991874958367182848	https://twitter.com/RadioFreeTom/status/991874958367182848			
	So, conservatives who still want to be around after the smoke clears are now trying to insulate themselves from the wrath of the conservative populists, who will blame them for being insufficiently pro-Trump and allowing Mueller to bring down their god-emperor. /4	RadioFreeTom	57	10	1525316392	991874957306048512	https://twitter.com/RadioFreeTom/status/991874957306048512			
	"Now that Mueller has really rattled multiple people who've been called in, the endgame of a major White House implosion - and of people facing jail time - is in the air. Maybe not soon, but the idea that ""collusion is over, and obstruction is all a farce"" isn't selling. /3"	RadioFreeTom	60	14	1525316392	991874956253278209	https://twitter.com/RadioFreeTom/status/991874956253278209			
	I might be way off here, but it's the only way to explain the baffling behavior of people who are too intelligent to be acting this panicky and dumb.

	So, unrelated to the travails of graduate students, I have a theory about why the conservative press and opinion leaders are freaking out and, ironically, becoming *more* critical of Mueller and more defensive of Trump. /1https://twitter.com/brooklynmarie/status/991867050199994368 …	RadioFreeTom	145	46	1525315666	991871910198763520	https://twitter.com/RadioFreeTom/status/991871910198763520
