	Nobody suggested otherwise. My stance is that “having it all” is a trap. Having it all means doing it all and it sucks. Two career households with young kids are some of the most stressed out hellholes that exist. Part-time stem jobs are few and far between.

	I missed breakfast. When I checked into the hotel, the gal said “you’re not signed up for breakfast!” I’m like “that’s fine.” And her eyes were wide “you’re going to wait each morning to decide about breakfast?” So then I said ok, sign me up, and she was genuinely relieved, lol.	haydentiff	94	4	1527418075	1000690055017566208	https://twitter.com/haydentiff/status/1000690055017566208

	Not *all* of the social network. For example, Earn uses a traditional database for most of the backend. But using a blockchain for *part* of the backend allows users to send/receive payments, encrypt messages, or interact with smart contracts.	balajis	2	0	1527445219	1000803905469534208	https://twitter.com/balajis/status/1000803905469534208			
	Ideally, people would use pseudonyms for the same reason Satoshi or Publius did: to ventilate important yet unpopular ideas, to avoid persecution rather than to inflict it. Life is not always ideal, but that’s the kind of pseudonymous network that could be on balance good.	balajis	6	0	1527404987	1000635157626290177	https://twitter.com/balajis/status/1000635157626290177			
	While I believe they had good intentions, I think they didn’t get the social balance right. IIRC, they had anonymous comments as opposed to pseudonymous.

	Agree. I think this is one of several different types of blockchain-first social networks that will arise. Earn and Steemit are two other varieties. Reason is that blockchain gives spendable balances and encryption capability to pseudonyms, making them much more interesting.https://twitter.com/rrhoover/status/1000542054873612289 …	balajis	119	19	1527403066	1000627102759227393	https://twitter.com/balajis/status/1000627102759227393

	That's how he tries to pay the cashback. Now here's the interesting thing: 99% of all affiliate and referral programs specifically exclude these kind of cashback offers.

	Banks need a narrative to get you TO short spx and make euro longs give up. Price hasn't even moved. THIS IS HOW MARKETS REALLY WORK.https://twitter.com/bamabroker/status/1000732875103326208 …	Bamabroker	18	2	1527428334	1000733081488297985	https://twitter.com/Bamabroker/status/1000733081488297985			
	Think about this. The Us Italy bond yield spread is at same place its been for 95% of time since 2014. Same place 95% of time where it is today and yet why now is Italy a concern?? And yet the last 1000 days you never heard about it. Why you ask??	Bamabroker	17	2	1527428284	1000732875103326208	https://twitter.com/Bamabroker/status/1000732875103326208			
	There is No really italy bond chart that exist in my eyes those doesn't take 2011 to NOW in context. Everyone else is garbage.	Bamabroker	2	0	1527428033	1000731819480887296	https://twitter.com/Bamabroker/status/1000731819480887296			
	Reality is. Until anyone has any sense and puts up a italy chart from 2011 with that data on it. It's an absolute scam to try and suck you short stocks and steal your money. Period.	Bamabroker	5	0	1527428000	1000731684168519680	https://twitter.com/Bamabroker/status/1000731684168519680			
	If you think Italy is collapsing soon this means you think Us was about to collapse is April. It's the same thing. Seems like a moronic statement that is the Us was going to collapse 30 days ago.

	Instead of people making idiotic statements about Italy is doomed and euro to collapse over 30 days move why not ask why Italy was considered way way way safer than US last month?? To me that's the mistake.https://twitter.com/bamabroker/status/1000730831470628869 …	Bamabroker	8	0	1527427880	1000731177479823360	https://twitter.com/Bamabroker/status/1000731177479823360			
	The really awesome thing about this chart is that italy charts going around making stuff look really bad there and the charts are ONLY 60 days. This one blows that scam up. As you see Italy yield spread back to Jan and we have morons calling for collapse of euro.https://twitter.com/schuldensuehner/status/1000295399888969728 …	Bamabroker	12	5	1527427797	1000730831470628869	https://twitter.com/Bamabroker/status/1000730831470628869
