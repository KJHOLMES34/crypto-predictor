	I was in a little plaza/mart grabbing Subway (fast food) and there was a Western Union office next to it (same roof) that had a check cashing sign in the window.

	We do need sufficient stability for social confidence, to make exchange possible. Both inflation and deflation kill exchange.

	That's an oddly confrontational question.

	Yeah. It's play money, and even then hedged. My point was simply to ask, like you, if stability a viable goal.

	I take a different, perhaps more discouraging view. People should voice their concerns, and questions, and the president should listen to them, as part of being prepared.

	10. The point is, whether you think highly or poorly of Donald Trump, none of this is going to be easy, and the situation in Korea is just as dangerous and tricky - if not more so - as it ever was. And if it starts to look easy, that's even more cause for concern.	prchovanec	13	0	1524161956	987032901253521408	https://twitter.com/prchovanec/status/987032901253521408			
	8. Finally, I'm discomforted by South Korean President Moon's desire to spout praise towards everyone, from Trump to Kim, ignoring slights or bigger concerns.

	7. I'm also discomforted by the new, and very sudden, rapproachment between Xi and Kim, after years of increasingly strained relations.

	5. I obviously fall into the latter camp. But at the end of the day, what matters isn't my instinct, or your instinct, but what actually happens in that meeting.
