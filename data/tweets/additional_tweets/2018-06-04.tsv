	Ok, what I obviously meant was 1 sat transactions, the minimum transaction is 250 bytes (that's a normal 1 input 2 output transaction) so at 1 sat fee that's 250 sats for 250 bytes. That's the absolute minimum that a transaction is going to cost. Now you can do the math in USD.

	"A normal transaction 1 input 2 output is 250 bytes. If BCash would go to $10k even a 1 sat transaction is $0.025. At $100k that's $0.25. So you see that even the smallest tx will be ""expensive"".

	No whataboutism there. What Trump is proposing now for tariffs was once what GOPers criticized on the left back in the 80s. Populism is poison, and don't think Democrats are immune to it.

	Dude-ette, this TIME article has been making the rounds for years, but it overstates the importance of something that wasn't enforced. It basically meant that now and then your local station had to let local cranks read a letter on the air. And it wouldn't have applied to cable.

	Uh, everyone: it would never have applied to cable. It was meant (and never really enforced) to apply to the then-scarce resource of public airwaves on the then-new thing, broadcast TV.

	No. It confirms me in my belief that the pre-populist GOP was a good vehicle for my kind of conservative beliefs, and that the real enemy of both parties is populism itself.https://twitter.com/kennybadger/status/1003464087488073728 …	RadioFreeTom	311	32	1528080195	1003467188735442945	https://twitter.com/RadioFreeTom/status/1003467188735442945

	Yes, but you'd have said that 20 years ago, too. It's tiring. I don't regret voting for Reagan and I'd do it again.
