	"Yep, absolutely agree. I definitely don't think that ""what the mechanism promotes"" solely determines outcomes, especially since there are often multiple mechanisms at play (eg. ""the marketplace of ideas""). But the selective pressure of mechanisms should not be discounted."

	My experience with @ BBC: Any content that challenged the govt line was met with, ‘needs to be more impartial.’ Journalists are required to be as ‘impartial’ as needed to adhere to govt’s position. Even comedy shows like # HIGNFY are heavily scrutinized/censored by govt.	maxkeiser	113	73	1529170914	1008041993954570240	https://twitter.com/maxkeiser/status/1008041993954570240		#	@
	3 areas that UK Govt keeps an extremely tight lid on in terms of speech: Brexit, fracking, and RBS/banking scandals. Virtually nothing is said on these topics that doesn’t get ‘special’ treatment by the govt. One common trick to censor content is to question ‘impartiality.’	maxkeiser	104	67	1529170740	1008041263600267264	https://twitter.com/maxkeiser/status/1008041263600267264			
	UK govt scrutinized every word of my @ BBC show to make sure it adhered to govt’s accepted positions. Govt routinely censored content. Free speech is dead in the UK.

bitcoin ethereum 	But unlike Bitcoin, Ethereum etc. you can't just spin up a key pair, share your public key with someone and they can send you EOS or other tokens on the network. You need to have someone (ie. an app) register an account against your public key on the blockchain first.	ummjackson	1	0	1529132277	1007879936768708610	https://twitter.com/ummjackson/status/1007879936768708610			
	"My understanding is that the user *does* generate a private key only they hold. Then then share the public key with the app/contract which generates the ""account"" for them, covering the cost of registration until the user can stake their own EOS.

	Mental model for this: the more sensory associations, the stronger the memory. Of the 5 senses, visual is the highest bandwidth (think about file size of a video vs. a song). Also, having multiple senses involved reinforces - ex how a song or smell can bring you back.	FEhrsam	28	5	1529170877	1008041838802956288	https://twitter.com/FEhrsam/status/1008041838802956288

	7/ just some prelim thoughts here, obviously lots can change in investigating and litigating case and ultimate sentence up to sentencing judge	katie_haun	3	0	1529178373	1008073280241057792	https://twitter.com/katie_haun/status/1008073280241057792			
	6/ If plea, expect far lower guidelines recommended prison range, ie single digits, bc w/plea parties may choose not to seek certain enhancements, agree on loss amount, and deft gets -3 levels for accepting responsibility	katie_haun	1	0	1529178326	1008073080114065409	https://twitter.com/katie_haun/status/1008073080114065409			
	5/Bottom line: if goes to trial expect govt to argue high loss amount, #victims, etc. so guidelines range may approach 11-14 yrs depending on govt establishing loss currently alleged	katie_haun	2	0	1529178305	1008072993451343873	https://twitter.com/katie_haun/status/1008072993451343873		#victims	
	4/ In this case amount of $ loss is what’s going to drive recommended guidelines prison term assuming conviction. Current indictment appears to allege approx $154m loss which adds +26 levels, though this could grow in superseding indictments (loss enhancements cap out at $550m)	katie_haun	1	0	1529178209	1008072591947358208	https://twitter.com/katie_haun/status/1008072591947358208			
	3/ Guidelines recommend #months in prison by combining prior crim history (here I) with offense level (here 7 for fraud) though level enhanced for e.g. #victims, amount of $ loss, complex or overseas conduct, etc. Allegation Theranos defrauded govt agencies could enhance more	katie_haun	0	0	1529178195	1008072532245692416	https://twitter.com/katie_haun/status/1008072532245692416		#months #victims

	@ wintonARK & @ CathieDWood did work on how value/jobs would be created from the coming automation while I was working @ ARKInvest, so I’m familiar with the pattern of misplaced fears.

	There will always be more jobs to feed the algos & capitalist machine, worry not.

	Hence, when we worry that algos will take our jobs we’re worrying about the wrong thing.
