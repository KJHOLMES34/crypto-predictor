ripple 	Bryce, if it’s labeled a security, its utility as a global settlement asset is killed. Believe me or don’t. There’s a reason why Ripple has only referred to it as a digital asset over the past few years, and never cryptocurrency.	haydentiff	2	0	1524891298	990091984072306688	https://twitter.com/haydentiff/status/990091984072306688			
	XRP isn’t used as a currency! It’s a global settlement asset. It cannot have obligations or liabilities. It has to function EXACTLY as it does now: as a digital public asset not redeemable from a counterparty (none-exist). Digital gold.	haydentiff	49	13	1524890575	990088948801294336	https://twitter.com/haydentiff/status/990088948801294336

	This has nothing to do with taking it out of public hands. It has to do with XRP’s current utility which will be destroyed simply by labeling it a security.	haydentiff	4	0	1524890166	990087233905586176	https://twitter.com/haydentiff/status/990087233905586176

	Actually, the Fed would not even have to intervene.

	"It's not really a revelation, and the right response to it should be a quiet ""Duh, we knew this,"" and then let Mueller get back to peeling the layers of this very stinky onion. /4x"	RadioFreeTom	317	51	1524886778	990073026690547714	https://twitter.com/RadioFreeTom/status/990073026690547714			
	As part of a general attack on the US political system, it's a smart move. It makes the Dems go nuts, forces the GOP to defend close ties with the Kremlin, and distracts everyone from the fact that the Russians were have long been jungled up with the Trumps. /3	RadioFreeTom	209	40	1524886729	990072820305743874	https://twitter.com/RadioFreeTom/status/990072820305743874			
	The Russians aren't giving away anything to the US intelligence community by letting Veselnitskaya talk this way; her status wasn't a secret to anyone smarter than Donald Trump Jr (which is to say, just about anyone). The goal is to create chaos, and this helps. /2	RadioFreeTom	225	48	1524886729	990072819307474944	https://twitter.com/RadioFreeTom/status/990072819307474944			
	"There's a simple answer to why Veselnitskaya is playing this game about admitting being a Kremlin asset: because why wouldn't she? It stirs the pot even more and makes the Trump family look just as dumb as they really are. This is called ""a strategy."" /1"	RadioFreeTom	396	138	1524886729	990072817982103552	https://twitter.com/RadioFreeTom/status/990072817982103552			
	The Korea handshake is not nothing. But the irony is that Trump's unhinged behavior and nutty tweets may have been the space Kim need to look *reasonable* by comparison. In other words, Trump's claiming a win when in fact Kim is walking off with all the chips on the table.https://twitter.com/PoliticAlBor/status/990066761700589568 …	RadioFreeTom	669	200	1524886377	990071344413970432	https://twitter.com/RadioFreeTom/status/990071344413970432

	It’s not a con. It’s a cost-free outflanking of the Americans and the sanctions regime by appearing to be the far more reasonable party - easy to do compared to Trump - without actually giving anything up.
