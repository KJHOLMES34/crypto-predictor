	"@ technocrypto's theory is to avoid pork, because pigs are apparently the most likely of the major food animals to have conscious experiences. I generally do that too.

	"So altogether, I don't think this particular way of positioning BTC with regard to existing fiat currencies is optimal. It relies too much on hard categories (""is a currency"" vs ""not a currency""), and would be better if it relied more on discussing properties and tradeoffs."

	And user protection is not optimal for all use cases; untrusted buyer, trusted seller situations are common, and for me personally, cryptocurrency has on occasion been a lifeline for buying plane tickets when all my credit cards get locked by overzealous anti-fraud mechanisms.
