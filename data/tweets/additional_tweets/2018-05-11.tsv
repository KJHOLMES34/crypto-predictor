	"Not  ‘no structure"" - ""no hierarchical structure"".  There is no top or bottom. Math can precisely transform hierarchical systems into distributed systems.

	The blockchain can support any distributed structure. If existing companies transformed to operate on the blockchain, all functions would be distributed.

	An event seldom changes our culture in ways that can be clearly seen, measured and felt. In the past 200 years, there have been two events. The first was The Industrial revolution.

	So I don't have any good ideas about how to do this. Even if I laid out a syllabus and somehow found the time to teach, where are the *students* going to find the time to learn? The *economics* just aren't there: how are the meditators to pay their way for. say, 10 years of work?	leashless	17	1	1525998601	994736348782366725	https://twitter.com/leashless/status/994736348782366725			
	It's taken me *years* to let go enough of that responsibility to be a truly effective actor inside of market capitalism: to put up the boundaries, and embrace the materialism and egotism enough to get a handle on capitalist reality. Any enlightenment tradition has to handle this.	leashless	29	1	1525998524	994736026953363459	https://twitter.com/leashless/status/994736026953363459			
	People will sabotage their own enlightenment to protect themselves from the crushing moral responsibility which lands on most shoulders after attainment. Being a monk protects from this, a bit, but for nearly everybody else it hits head on: you *can* help, so you *must* help.	leashless	21	3	1525998306	994735112943276034	https://twitter.com/leashless/status/994735112943276034			
	To make it work you'd need a Western institution which could support students through most of a ten or fifteen year practice, and put them to work in a direct confrontation with the ills of the world as workers to pay their way and harden them enough to survive being enlightened.	leashless	14	1	1525998230	994734794327101440	https://twitter.com/leashless/status/994734794327101440			
	That's the sort of strain which real attainment requires in these traditions. This, for example https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaih%C5%8Dgy%C5%8D … does not exist because lesser medicine cured all the patients. You are not going to get a slick, cooperative enlightenment tradition in the west: not happening.	leashless	17	0	1525998026	994733936889749504	https://twitter.com/leashless/status/994733936889749504			
	My advice to everybody doing meditation or anything vaguely similar: do *the least you can* and still get some benefits, or (if you want to see it through) be prepared to dedicate 5 to 8 years to it full time, and lose almost everyone in your life and most of your material assets	leashless	31	5	1525997878	994733317206528001	https://twitter.com/leashless/status/994733317206528001			
	What you have is a folk tradition, mostly Tibetan Buddhist propaganda and marketing in the 1960s when they desperately needed money and political asylum. They told you all this stuff was cool: it's not. It's horrifically hard, dangerous, and of uncertain benefit for most people.	leashless	26	3	1525997787	994732936091111426	https://twitter.com/leashless/status/994732936091111426			
	Maybe you recover afterwards, maybe you wind up living in a lighthouse staring at the world like the cosmic mystery play it really is.

	"Here, there's this ""we can have it all in one life"" myth: spiritual and financial and personal life success all at the same time, with no trade offs - a sort of LEAN IN philosophy. Yeah, let me tell you: not if you're going for enlightenment. It'll rip your life off your bones."	leashless	37	5	1525997596	994732133175447552	https://twitter.com/leashless/status/994732133175447552			
	But there are times, and prices to be paid. People who are heavily on the spiritual path in their 20s in India are guided towards renunciation and a monastic life in many cases, because doing work and family life while on that path is horrific for all parties in many cases.	leashless	23	1	1525997508	994731762659086336	https://twitter.com/leashless/status/994731762659086336			
	"There are a couple of decent plateaux where a person can do so much ""spiritual stuff"" and stop. But you need skilled teachers to spot those plateaux, and stick logs in the gears that would propel people into the next dangerous bit.

	Let me say this very clearly: the last stages of the approach towards enlightenment are lethally dangerous. People go mad, people die, people break in ways which ruin the remainder of their lives and stay just subclinical. Even with skilled instructors, this stuff is COMMONPLACE.	leashless	26	5	1525997376	994731210575314944	https://twitter.com/leashless/status/994731210575314944

	The air smells like war tonight. Just those early harbingers, the unconscious tension. I think that humans can detect war in the same way that horses detect earthquakes - some subtle parsing of weak signals into a whole. some hard to extract gestalt that smells of cordite smoke.	leashless	42	5	1525996669	994728245152149504	https://twitter.com/leashless/status/994728245152149504

	Ask yourself if some insurance firm or auto dealer would have supported you in, say, 1988 if you took out a billboard saying something racist or even controversial.

	Yep, Fox is unique in the self-pity stuff, but I disagree: the other nets aren't as bad.

	It's tough to be old. I've watched my father and my relatives pass on. I get it. But constant rage isn't going to help anyone live longer.
