	The first option provided clearly allows for the escrowed funds to be included in the denominator... did you not read the tweet?

	The strap system is great and I haven't felt the weight to be a problem at all. It's 3DoF and the tracking is fantastic. It *does* have built-in sound, which projects backwards from the headset - spatial audio is great. Others can hear it though, so 3.5mm jack also included.	ummjackson	1	0	1525655803	993298548371345408	https://twitter.com/ummjackson/status/993298548371345408

	I feel like the optics are on par with the Vive, yep. Field of view might be slightly lower. Obviously the apps you're running won't be as visually advanced as something you'd run on a gaming machine.

	I've never owned a headset personally, but have used Rift/Vives a lot over the years (incl. the VR World in Japan, which is amazing). At $200, there is no excuse to not jump in with this thing. I've been using it daily, it's so convenient.	ummjackson	1	0	1525655394	993296832770985984	https://twitter.com/ummjackson/status/993296832770985984

	If you've ever wanted to try out VR but don't have a powerful computer, or are a developer and want to try out VR dev (incl. WebVR which is supported) I highly recommend this thing.	ummjackson	5	0	1525655278	993296346789462016	https://twitter.com/ummjackson/status/993296346789462016			
	Pros: - Great optics, better than the Rift in my experience - Processor is snappy and hasn't lagged for me (yet) - Setup is a breeze - 3 hour battery is impressive The only Con I see is the software library still feeling a little limited.

	I personally picked up the 64gb model, as the storage space required stacks up quickly as you install some of the bigger titles that are more than just tech demos. https://amzn.to/2IgTYJA  It's unreal to instantly be in VR the second you put this cable-free thing on your head.	ummjackson	14	0	1525655084	993295534092779520	https://twitter.com/ummjackson/status/993295534092779520			
	I ended up buckling and buying the Oculus Go because they have a better software library than Google Daydream right now... wow, this thing shouldn't be as good as it is for $200. I've been a skeptic for so long but really think this could be the beginning of VR going mainstream.	ummjackson	65	2	1525654935	993294909846142977	https://twitter.com/ummjackson/status/993294909846142977

	This is not the issue. Most merchants use payment processors in order to accept crypto. It doesn’t matter how fast $ XRP is if payment processors don’t want to touch it and nobody that supports XRP is willing to build a competitor.https://twitter.com/gregcobb77/status/993525198115635200 …	haydentiff	18	2	1525710846	993529418562891777	https://twitter.com/haydentiff/status/993529418562891777			
	Thank you for the reply. I will send a DM with the email address. To clarify, has Coinbase completely stopped offering payment processing services to retailers?
