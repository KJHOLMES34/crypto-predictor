	And if you were expecting a hint as to what those new @ Civickey products are in this tweetstorm, sorry to disappoint you. Another reason for Apple’s success is that until the product launches, keeping everyone in the dark is the best way to extend your lead as a first mover...	VinnyLingham	66	13	1522953280	981963344692166656	https://twitter.com/VinnyLingham/status/981963344692166656			@
	Most importantly, it’s not the products that seem obvious to the market so if they work or gain traction, replicating them becomes a lot harder and everyone else is then competing for second place. It’s better to be an innovator and fail, then be competing for second place, IMHO.	VinnyLingham	30	9	1522953279	981963342406270976	https://twitter.com/VinnyLingham/status/981963342406270976			
	This is one of the reasons that first mover advantage is so important in business. Be the first mover, and keep moving. Innovate, fail, learn, productize. So while we now have many competitors @ civickey, while they’re playing catchup, we’re building and launching new products.	VinnyLingham	58	14	1522953279	981963340544028672	https://twitter.com/VinnyLingham/status/981963340544028672			@
	So, while everyone is watching how a space gets crowded, invariably it’s really about watching everyone chase the innovator or market leader. They tend to stay ahead by suprising the market with thought leading innovations instead of spending time trying to play catch up.	VinnyLingham	16	3	1522953278	981963338736271360	https://twitter.com/VinnyLingham/status/981963338736271360			
	Executable innovation is really the key here. Innovation that you can actually execute on is allows you to build products that customers really want. Steve was not always successful, but he learnt and adapted. In my experience, it’s the ability to productize learnings that wins.	VinnyLingham	20	5	1522953278	981963337192783872	https://twitter.com/VinnyLingham/status/981963337192783872			
	If you’re constantly copying the market leader, you’re not learning from their mistakes, just replicating their outputs. That’s a dangerous situation for any company. Learning from mistakes gives companies the best tool for innovation.	VinnyLingham	25	6	1522953277	981963335401795585	https://twitter.com/VinnyLingham/status/981963335401795585			
	As Steve Jobs said: “A lot of times, people don't know what they want until you show it to them.” Executable innovation is one of the toughest things to do in business. Ideas are dime a dozen. When you’re in a space where there are a number of competitors, copying is not enough.	VinnyLingham	216	80	1522953277	981963332813864960	https://twitter.com/VinnyLingham/status/981963332813864960

	They banned banks from working with cryptocurrency companies. They didn't ban trading, or owning, or wallets, or exchanges.

	Shutting down bank accounts of exchanges that are following the rules won't stop cryptocurrency trading. It will only move it to black markets that don't do KYC.

	They can always cash out into cash, as a secondary cash market is guaranteed to pop up.

	Haha there has been a bunch of windmill-tilting on this subject going widely around in recent days, starting with Vitalik's comment. :-)	NickSzabo4	9	0	1522957267	981980068292378625	https://twitter.com/NickSzabo4/status/981980068292378625			
	Alas, economists generally take for granted that underlying legal institutions function perfectly, and thus tend to have a very poor understanding of trust minimization.	NickSzabo4	9	0	1522956633	981977411288887297	https://twitter.com/NickSzabo4/status/981977411288887297			
	For decades my interest has been, besides a scientific curiosity about what really happened, technological, i.e. how to design better forms of money. That branched into figuring out what objects were used for money or similar & why they were designed the way they were.	NickSzabo4	8	1	1522955718	981973571994963968	https://twitter.com/NickSzabo4/status/981973571994963968			
	This can be a good way to define things, but it's very different from standard economic definitions, so be careful. Graeber's theory, so far as I can discern his theory, is that early money *accompanies* debt, it doesn't itself usually take the *form of* debt.	NickSzabo4	5	1	1522953782	981965453504335872	https://twitter.com/NickSzabo4/status/981965453504335872			
	Indeed outside of modern Western culture a store of value function is usually condensed with display of wealth and often has religious implications.	NickSzabo4	5	3	1522953350	981963639182667776	https://twitter.com/NickSzabo4/status/981963639182667776			
	Those are just official reserves, gold holding in India is far more decentralized, since their jewelry has high gold content and they treat it as SoV.	NickSzabo4	21	2	1522951995	981957957528109056	https://twitter.com/NickSzabo4/status/981957957528109056			
	That's still a very different kind of transfer from kids giving each other gifts. Descriptions should use language that makes clear such distinctions. And kings and diplomats themselves are very far removed from the neolithic and forager cultures involved in the origins of money.

	If you define it that broadly and vaguely, then unit of account may have been practically universal. A better specified definition is needed.	NickSzabo4	0	0	1522951041	981953957592383488	https://twitter.com/NickSzabo4/status/981953957592383488			
	Good to hear. Our disagreements are likely 1) how seriously we take small definitional distinctions, (2) role of evolution, 3) moral & political lessons we draw, 4) he doesn't know what my theories actually are & is attacking strawmen (I'm no big expert on his theories either).

	Numerical measurement and counting like 1-2-3-4-... (as opposed to visually mapping sets of objects) were not necessary for SoV or media of wealth transfer to evolve.	NickSzabo4	1	0	1522949758	981948576275185664	https://twitter.com/NickSzabo4/status/981948576275185664			
	"""Giving gifts."" Akin to anthropology books titled ""The Children of X."" As if they were just innocent kids dancing around Christmas trees and we should be more like them. ""Gift"" is lazy translation of thousands of unique indigenous words describing usually obligatory transfers."

	That's not a very credible thought, since I have studied that and much else related to early stores of value and media of wealth transfer.

	In fact, trust minimizing institutions and technologies are crucial to expanding human relationships beyond the clan level. Much of this moral primitivism you cite, when applied to much larger societies, would or have lead to barbarity, e.g. of communist states.

	That's not what I'm doing, but even if it was why could I not?

	In these definition-mongering accounts of money, beads (for example) can apparently magically go from being nothing like money at all to being fully money by the mere act of transferring them for one kind of purpose instead of another.

	An IOU for silver to be paid in 10 weeks. Not much time for the IOU itself to act as money, but the silver could serve as a great unit of account and store of wealth, and as a passable medium of exchange, despite predating the invention of coinage by about 1200 years.

	We disagree here. I also spent 13 years in NYC and lived and owned a car in LA and called it my personal jail cell. The subway offers more freedom.

	I have a feeling these tweets are decreasing my chances but since he already refused, I think they were at zero anyway ... so funny how, before I'd tweeted articles critical of XRP, he really wanted to be on my show.

	Also, if banks are the users of XRP, why do everyday people own it? Tokens are meant to replace middlemen with the incentives of the token system/cryptoeconomics instead. There's no reason for the token to exist if the middlemen are kept in place.	laurashin	6	3	1522884696	981675684215967745	https://twitter.com/laurashin/status/981675684215967745			
bitcoin ripple 	Yes^ + unlike bitcoin or ether, where the success isn't dependent upon any particular entity but token users and developers contribute to the value of the system, with XRP, its success depends on Ripple getting banks & FIs to use it.

	Heard a great interview with the creative director of the Forza game series, on the # Autonocast # podcast, where he described Audi introducing a new car... in-game to Forza gamers. # Car # tokenization - non-fungible, non-ICO - could be similar, a new dealer or marketing model.	jgarzik	3	2	1522956784	981978042003271685	https://twitter.com/jgarzik/status/981978042003271685		# # # #	
	This could be a new way for car companies to explore a new market or engage with buyers.

	FWIW, sure, Maddow is biased but she’s intelligent, not crazy, and is not even remotely comparable to her competition.
