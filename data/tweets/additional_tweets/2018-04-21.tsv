	It appears I was wrong, that one does need to make a BTC tx to receive lightning payments. However, once open it can remain open for as long as you want. Also, the less urgency you have, the cheaper you can make the tx that opens the channel (i.e. you can use a lower fee).

	The fact that China and North Korea are acting all chummy all of a sudden, after years when China was seriously questioning whether Kim was an asset or a liability, has me pretty alarmed.	prchovanec	25	7	1524282066	987536678926667776	https://twitter.com/prchovanec/status/987536678926667776			
	I should say China's ideal objective. It was willing to settle for status quo ante, with US force not camped on its immediate border. But it would have preferred for the US to be out of the Korean Peninsula entirely.	prchovanec	12	0	1524281370	987533761112834048	https://twitter.com/prchovanec/status/987533761112834048			
	This is also what worries me about Kim's new rapprochement with China. I worry that this lightbulb may have gone off in Xi's mind as well, that China's original objective in the Korean War may be nearer than they ever hoped.	prchovanec	15	1	1524281103	987532639396618241	https://twitter.com/prchovanec/status/987532639396618241			
	The danger is that by focusing mainly on North Korea's nuclear threat to the US, and seeking to remove it at all costs - America First, leave Asia to the Asians - we play exactly their game.	prchovanec	15	4	1524280832	987531503348436994	https://twitter.com/prchovanec/status/987531503348436994

	If you hand North Korea what they want (the US permanently out of the picture), they will be quite happy to at least suspend work on their nuclear arsenal, because it will have accomplished its immediate purpose.	prchovanec	22	3	1524280442	987529867179814912	https://twitter.com/prchovanec/status/987529867179814912			
	North Korea's END GOAL is not to develop nuclear weapons and ICBMs. Its goal is to remove the US from the equation in Korea, and thereby position itself as an equal if not dominant partner vis-a-vis South Korea. Nuclear weapons and ICBMs are simply instruments to that end.	prchovanec	104	55	1524280338	987529430137556992	https://twitter.com/prchovanec/status/987529430137556992
