ethereum 	Securities Act of ‘33 outlawed Ethereum-type offerings prevalent on Wall St. leading up to ‘29 crash. So yea, ETH is a security. The question is, will the SEC be accommodative?

	That's why you have to tokenise the asset. A house as an asset isn't owned through it being a house. It's owned through the legal title.

bitcoin 	If I can prove the asset exists and the state of it's title, I modified the risk dynamic in the market.

	Transparency is the wrong word. The fundemental problem you outline is I need to know that what I see is what you see.

	Tokens backed by diamonds make zero sense. Thought that was a given, but didn't state it. Which on the internet I grant you could mean I didn't have a clue... Securitised diamond trading could make sense on its own imo.

	Some assets have been very successfully securitised of course. Typically highly liquid institutions are involved (e.g. central banks, FMIs). Not the case with diamonds. Therefore they're more risky. The new input is data about risk that was opaque previously	sytaylor	0	0	1525596659	993050480266874881	https://twitter.com/sytaylor/status/993050480266874881

	"You calling it ""relevant evidence"" doesn't make it ""relevant evidence."" That's a way of embedding a separate argument as a distracting merely by asserting it in passing. There's plenty here POTUS should answer if Strzok never texted a word. And you know this."

	You think that Strzok's personal texts are relevant to whether Trump's campaign colluded with Russians, or whether Trump obstructed justice? You're grasping at this thinnest of straws, but I'm the deranged one? We'd still be facing all this even If Peter Strzok never existed.
