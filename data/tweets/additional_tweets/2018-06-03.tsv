bitcoin 	The friction wouldn’t be felt until Coinbase started needing to tap into cold storage to complete the Bitcoin transfers.

bitcoin 	The more I think about it, the more impossible it seems to predict.

	No. I didn’t imply anything. Anytime you don’t transact P2P you are at the mercy of middlemen. Moving on... Once MoneyGram, WU, and others move beyond piloting, we will hopefully see more competition. As customers, we can apply pressure.	haydentiff	6	0	1528004200	1003148442603016192	https://twitter.com/haydentiff/status/1003148442603016192

ripple 	At this point, unless there is a large crypto network on each end, you’re at the mercy of a bank or remittence company. MoneyGram and Western Union have been piloting Ripple. As a customer, you could apply pressure. That’s all that I can think of right now.

	You should only “invest” what you are willing to lose. Crypto is very volatile and nothing is guaranteed. My personal belief is that XRP is a long-term hold, so short-term fluctuations in price don’t phase me. People expecting immediate gains are often (very) unhappy with XRP.	haydentiff	5	0	1527988308	1003081782856740866	https://twitter.com/haydentiff/status/1003081782856740866

	It’s the volatility of crypto that makes it hard for low margin business transaction more than the fee. You could lose 2.5% in volatility. This is why cash user case has struggled to get adoption rather than transaction fees IMO.

	Unless your business has a low margin & you have to pay suppliers in fiat then crypto is bad cash. It’s OK for high margin business if you believe in the HODL. That’s why BTC became a store of value as most cash only work when the currency is priced in the same Currency you pay.

	Based on this argument $ BCH only becomes good cash when things are priced in $ BCH - this is my opinion why $ BTC became a store of value over everyday cash as the world still prices things in fiat & why $ BCH may not be good cash.

	Nobody has asked me to pay them in lightning transaction yet? They ask me to pay them on-chain. If that is the case we will see but I don’t think that is a fact yet.

	No. That called a loaded question. I ask them for their real answer, not the answer I want to tell them. How can regulators regulate $ BTC as it uses segwit? Genuine question. I’m curious.

	I have been evangelizing crypto since 2011 all around world & it’s based on my experience speaking with people. In my book ‘Bank To The Future’ I did a study on debt levels and how most people are in debt as they earn less than they spend and most income goes on rent / mortgage.

	I ask everybody why they want us to pay them in that currency yes. The answer is usually because they believe the value of that Currency will go up and they want to hold it. Others like $ ETH because it’s faster and cheaper.

	I’ve only had one supplier ask me to pay in $ BCH so far so not seen many merchants yet but I like the way $ BCH is pushing for merchant adoption and making that a primary focus.

	Well in that case why would you spend it as cash? Is it not more logical to spend $ BTC if you think that will go down and save your $ BCH that your know will go up.

	I use a lot of crypto every day.

	I’m curious crypto people - what do you actually use as cash right now? I still find $ ETH $ BTC $ USD and $ USDT more useful as cash over $ BCH at the moment as it is more accepted in the case of $ ETH $ BTC and $ USD or has the stability needed for cash in the case of $ USDT and $ USD.

	Well I don’t think I picked the wrong side. If $ BTC needs to learn from $ BCH then it should. The $ BTC chain is still the most important in my view and it should not get complacent.

	Non-tariff barriers are obstacles to foreign companies accessing a market.

	There's also the possibility that the lowered barriers to entry into the pundit/troll game now offer possibilities that I didn't have.

	My father was Archie Bunker, except that he had a sharp, empirical mind that couldn't brook the double-think it required. And my mother was basically an empath.

	I think it's worth doing.

	I think I understand guys like Bannon and Miller, because I went through a time where I felt as they did. What I don't understand is how they've stayed on that path. Maybe it's money. Maybe an absence of religion. I don't know. But seeing now them makes me glad I didn't. /14x	RadioFreeTom	967	74	1527994384	1003107269616250880	https://twitter.com/RadioFreeTom/status/1003107269616250880			
	And yes, some of it I didn't outgrow. I'm still an arrogant jerk who deals in moral absolutes more often than I should. But I don't live my life to make other people angry. I never had that luxury - and also, because it's not normal to wallow in hostility every day. /13	RadioFreeTom	764	66	1527994384	1003107268731252737	https://twitter.com/RadioFreeTom/status/1003107268731252737			
	And it's nagged me, because I can remember being young, insecure, angry at a liberal culture that was alien to me, and responding with the kind of trolly jerkishness you see in Miller. I remember a lot of us that way. *When we were teenagers.* /12	RadioFreeTom	432	39	1527994384	1003107267951067136	https://twitter.com/RadioFreeTom/status/1003107267951067136			
	There's more to this, and I'm still kind of noodling it out, but this entire administration seems full of well-off but socially maladjusted people, from the President on down, who keep playing out their anger at some sort of 7th grade gym class humiliation. /11	RadioFreeTom	1450	319	1527994383	1003107266663534597	https://twitter.com/RadioFreeTom/status/1003107266663534597			
	Maybe that's unfair, since I don't know Miller, and I can only extrapolate from what I see on TV and in the Coppins piece. But every time I see him, I think of him as being about 19, and as the guy in seminar who makes you roll your eyes whenever his hand goes up. /10	RadioFreeTom	562	32	1527994383	1003107265770151937	https://twitter.com/RadioFreeTom/status/1003107265770151937			
	But again, all of the permanently juvenile behavior - and this is the most unserious, juvenile White House in history - is enabled by money. Reading the Coppins piece, I keep thinking that Miller, who is clearly smart, could have been changed by a girlfriend and a real job. /9	RadioFreeTom	678	72	1527994383	1003107264780275712	https://twitter.com/RadioFreeTom/status/1003107264780275712			
	And then, you grow up. Education, if it had an impact on you, makes you understand that the world is complicated. You realize that your anger at the hypocrisy of smug liberals is legit, sure, but that the world isn't the Model UN debate team. /8	RadioFreeTom	482	41	1527994383	1003107263911989248	https://twitter.com/RadioFreeTom/status/1003107263911989248			
	More than that, your social life is about more than bullshitting about politics with other privileged kids. (I have no idea whether Miller was dating, but that's another wrinkle: trollery was not, uh, a recipe for social success. You had to have other social skills. ) /7	RadioFreeTom	441	31	1527994383	1003107263056433152	https://twitter.com/RadioFreeTom/status/1003107263056433152			
	You not only have to worry about how you'll feed yourself, but you're also spending a lot of time off campus and talking to normal people for whom politics isn't some sort of leisure-time intramural activity. It's the real world, where you'd also like to have friends. /6	RadioFreeTom	606	49	1527994382	1003107261999452161	https://twitter.com/RadioFreeTom/status/1003107261999452161			
	Simply put, you have to have a cushion of money to be a jackass and *stay* a jackass on Miller's scale. I couldn't be a full-time campus idiot - I wasn't even a part time one - because I was at what was then a working class school, and I was working two jobs. That changes you. /5	RadioFreeTom	795	105	1527994382	1003107260049051650	https://twitter.com/RadioFreeTom/status/1003107260049051650			
	But I think some of the difference between Miller and conservative kids like me was the Age of Reagan, where we imbibed RR's sunny confidence instead of the prissy, dour bitchiness of Fox and Breitbart and Trump. But the other factor, I'm sure now, was: Affluence. /4	RadioFreeTom	696	102	1527994381	1003107257964486656	https://twitter.com/RadioFreeTom/status/1003107257964486656			
	Unlike Miller, I didn't grow up reading trashy NRA crap and Limbaugh books. I also didn't have the smarts to read stuff from Modern Age and all that, even though for some reason I kept getting it in the mail. Orwell and Aurelius affected me. As did growing up in Kennedy Land. /3	RadioFreeTom	264	23	1527994381	1003107256118972416	https://twitter.com/RadioFreeTom/status/1003107256118972416			
	Miller grew up surrounded by self-righteous, hypocritical liberal orthodoxy in California; I had the same experience in Massachusetts. It *does* make you trollish, and to want to puncture the smug liberalism of people that you know are NIMBY liberals. I was that way as a teen. /2	RadioFreeTom	277	23	1527994381	1003107255217262594	https://twitter.com/RadioFreeTom/status/1003107255217262594			
	Having now read this @ mckaycoppins piece on Miller for the second time, I think I've figured out the pebble in my shoe about guys like Miller. I went through the same trollish phase. (But not as nutty.) But I've been thinking about why some of us outgrow it. /1	RadioFreeTom	946	322	1527992579	1003099697324724225	https://twitter.com/RadioFreeTom/status/1003099697324724225			@
