	Oh I'm not saying Monero isn't serious about privacy. I'm saying that Zcash is also serious about privacy, and I feel its privacy is less likely to break (most technical risk re SNARKs is concentrated around soundness, which affects hodlers, not users)	VitalikButerin	43	10	1525781305	993824944525135873	https://twitter.com/VitalikButerin/status/993824944525135873			
	I trust the security model more. Hard indistinguishability of every tx, vs a much fuzzier thing involving mixins.

	For higher growth (and more volatile) economies, this means inflation target with larger buffer above 0% to avoid deflation. For example, India currently growing 7.3%/yr, central bank targets 4% inflation: https://www.bloomberg.com/amp/news/articles/2017-12-12/india-s-inflation-exceeds-estimate-surges-to-15-month-high …	FEhrsam	6	1	1525761488	993741826375872512	https://twitter.com/FEhrsam/status/993741826375872512			
	Attempt at practical framing: goal of inflation target is maintain psychology of “spend rather than hold”. Also, traditional central banker risk/reward says better to have slightly higher inflation than risk deflationary spiral. Thus 0%-2% US target rather than -0.5%-1.5%.

	It turns out that not all customers are the same, and that if you are juuuuust on the right side of p*ssing them off so much they leave you can both keep the customer AND get more loot.

	It's a vicious circle.

	Six of one, half a dozen of the other. Certainly is the case that price doesn't give full story. However, reality of many pricing depts is it makes sense to leave as little money on the table as possible. And your renewal book has a higher elasticity. So their price goes up.	charliehalkett	3	0	1525787150	993849460865236998	https://twitter.com/charliehalkett/status/993849460865236998

bitcoin 	Supplemental Notes: This is a demonstration of how to read the NVT charts, it's not meant as a price call for your trading, always trade to your own strategy. NVT Signal: http://charts.woobull.com/bitcoin-nvt-signal/ … NVT Ratio: http://charts.woobull.com/bitcoin-nvt-ratio/ … /9	woonomic	68	14	1525759582	993733832439349249	https://twitter.com/woonomic/status/993733832439349249			
	But price-wise I don't think we are that far from the bottom. So not far to go on the short side, lots of long to go when it fully unwinds and sets up in the second half of this year. /8	woonomic	48	9	1525759582	993733830375698432	https://twitter.com/woonomic/status/993733830375698432			
	Putting it all together, BTC is still unwinding from mania, I think we are on the plateau of another dead cat, I put the next downward move, more gentle this time in the window of 7-14 days from now. /7	woonomic	38	8	1525759582	993733828328865794	https://twitter.com/woonomic/status/993733828328865794			
	If I was trading this, I'd wait until NVT Signal's support line is broken before selling. More info: https://woobull.com/nvt-signal-a-new-trading-indicator-to-pick-tops-and-bottoms/ … /6pic.twitter.com/yJfkWc2kWM	woonomic	39	11	1525759580	993733823748751360	https://twitter.com/woonomic/status/993733823748751360			
	If we check NVT Signal, which is faster reacting and better as a shorter term inter-day/week trade indicator to time tops and bottoms, we can see we are climbing into the high zone again, it's similar to the June 2014 dead cat bounce /5pic.twitter.com/DGnY9ydflO	woonomic	41	9	1525759579	993733818795286528	https://twitter.com/woonomic/status/993733818795286528			
	If prior rates of normalising back to normal range is anything to go by, we can expect BTCUSD to be properly unwound and ready for accumulation in Q3/Q4 2018. /4pic.twitter.com/0FmydliVJd	woonomic	43	9	1525759578	993733814311514112	https://twitter.com/woonomic/status/993733814311514112			
	Standard NVT is laggy and sees a rise in the dead cat bounce of the price cycle. Right now BTC is unwinding from the last mania phase, akin to mid-2014. It's still in the over-valued range well above its normal band. It needs to unwind more. /3pic.twitter.com/YBsdzh3JGr	woonomic	36	9	1525759577	993733810175983616	https://twitter.com/woonomic/status/993733810175983616			
bitcoin 	Refresher. NVT values BTC as if it's a payment network like PayPal or Visanet, you can use the value flowing through the network as a proxy for earning and therefore network valuation. This holds true for Bitcoin's network too. https://woobull.com/introducing-nvt-ratio-bitcoins-pe-ratio-use-it-to-detect-bubbles/ … /2	woonomic	32	7	1525759577	993733808020058112	https://twitter.com/woonomic/status/993733808020058112			
	Lots of conflicting bull and bear calls right now on BTCUSD. I've been asked a lot regarding my opinion. Let's see what NVT ratio says...

	Not what I said, I said that I have about a 25% probability that we bounce of 1.3k, my next highest at around 23% is is at 4.9k, then I'd say about 12% for ~3k. So that's 60%. I would then split that last 40% with 20% that we fall under 6k and 20% that the bottom is in.	ToneVays	5	1	1525798927	993898855023501312	https://twitter.com/ToneVays/status/993898855023501312
