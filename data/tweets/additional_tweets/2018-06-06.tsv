	"Except that setting up three services is a huge pain, and that's the whole point!

	I used to agree with this logic; I no longer do. A user should assume that they are average, and so will themselves have an average loss rate. So *in expectation* it's still true that with *any* net issuance, the percent of total supply that any user holds will decrease over time	VitalikButerin	42	4	1528256243	1004205583677788160	https://twitter.com/VitalikButerin/status/1004205583677788160

	The idea that you need two rounds of confirmation to finalize is basically a cornerstone of BFT theory since the 1980s.

	Debt keeps chasing ‘higher yield’ (Junk) and longer maturities (like Argentina’s new 100 yr bonds). BTC is not debt. What’s the connection?

	In the meantime, to all those building real value - keep your heads down and ignore the noise. Long term fundamentals matter - in good times and bad. Survivors can ultimately become winners.	VinnyLingham	183	26	1528314614	1004450411799986176	https://twitter.com/VinnyLingham/status/1004450411799986176			
	The biggest risk now is that a 10x run on a $400bn is basically going to create $4trn in fictional value if it’s not driven by fundamentals. That’s a recipe for disaster. I’m hopefully we can avoid it, but I fear we won’t.	VinnyLingham	122	20	1528314614	1004450409912545280	https://twitter.com/VinnyLingham/status/1004450409912545280			
	So, like I said previously, the longer the markets are bearish the better. It gives us time to consolidate, build and grow so that when the next run happens, it’s based on real value not future speculation of value (as the current one is).	VinnyLingham	52	8	1528314613	1004450408020901888	https://twitter.com/VinnyLingham/status/1004450408020901888			
	I’m hoping that we can quickly build real value in the crypto economy and start growing the global economy at a faster pace by disrupting the old with the new and unlocking value in society. Speculation alone will not do this - we need real world applications and usage.	VinnyLingham	51	9	1528314613	1004450405932134402	https://twitter.com/VinnyLingham/status/1004450405932134402			
	Again, my views are predicated on the fact that relative to the size of the crypto economy there is very little value add to the real world economies still. Disruption takes time but greed and fomo are impatient. When these two collide, the best and worst come to the fore.	VinnyLingham	44	5	1528314612	1004450403973398528	https://twitter.com/VinnyLingham/status/1004450403973398528			
	If you think you’ve seen regulators getting rough, wait till you see what happens if we go 5-10x+ from here in less than a year and then crashing down 80%+. The ensuing fallout could send us into a global recession.	VinnyLingham	37	6	1528314612	1004450401813319680	https://twitter.com/VinnyLingham/status/1004450401813319680			
	However, if the speculative mania gets worse and we go from <$500bn to $5bn+ without sufficient infrastructure, utility and usage, when that bubble bursts it will wreak havoc upon the global economy.	VinnyLingham	41	6	1528314611	1004450399791734784	https://twitter.com/VinnyLingham/status/1004450399791734784			
	I don’t think crypto is in an unsustainable bubble right now. If we go sideways for the next 12-18 months it will be healthy as it gives the technologists time to build product and adoption.	VinnyLingham	445	101	1528314610	1004450396176175104	https://twitter.com/VinnyLingham/status/1004450396176175104

	Hashrate follows the money. BCH hashrate has been consistently around 10-15% of the BTC hashrate and it will require a fairly monumental event to alter that ratio.

	6/ The path I expect considering the past and a best guess of the future...is that alts continue to act like 'leveraged' $ btc positions following its movements with high corr until market forces cause $ BTC volatility to spike.
