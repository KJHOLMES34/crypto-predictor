	MLCCの供給逼迫、消費者には関係なさそうですが「欲しい製品は早めに手に入れておいたほうがいいかも？」とは言える。予定していた以上の追加発注が難しくなっているわけですから、商品が予想外に売れるなどして切れた場合補充までに時間が…、という話。	mochi_wsj	5	4	1530362044	1013037954606948352	https://twitter.com/mochi_wsj/status/1013037954606948352			
	If you are planning to buy some gadgets, you may want to get it right away. MLCC is usually same-day delivery, but wait time now is 6 months, meaning making additional component orders due to demand surge difficult for gadget makers.https://www.wsj.com/articles/cant-find-a-playstation-4-blame-it-on-a-part-barely-bigger-than-a-speck-1530282882?mod=hp_lista_pos1 …	mochi_wsj	6	4	1530361390	1013035213323038720	https://twitter.com/mochi_wsj/status/1013035213323038720			
	MLCC、買えていないメーカーは無いものの急な追加発注への対応が難しいと。アナリストは「普段なら即日手に入るが足元では6ヶ月位かかっている」。先日は台湾ペガトロンのトップがわざわざ村田に出向いていました。村田は約18年ぶりの値上げが先日明らかになり株価が急伸。 https://www.wsj.com/articles/cant-find-a-playstation-4-blame-it-on-a-part-barely-bigger-than-a-speck-1530282882 …	mochi_wsj	18	7	1530360861	1013032994515238912	https://twitter.com/mochi_wsj/status/1013032994515238912

	MLCC、あらゆる製品を動かすのに不可欠な部材なのですが簡単に製造できないので供給が限られています。村田や太陽誘電が強い分野。数ヶ月前PS4がお店から消えた理由の一つはこれ。調達難度が上がっているので製品に対する需要の急激な伸びに対応しにくくなっています。 https://www.wsj.com/articles/cant-find-a-playstation-4-blame-it-on-a-part-barely-bigger-than-a-speck-1530282882 …	mochi_wsj	18	22	1530318477	1012855223205806081	https://twitter.com/mochi_wsj/status/1012855223205806081

	"""The Oil Kings"" is about the rivalry between Iran and Saudi Arabia - both US allies at the time - during the 1970s, when the Shah was intent on pushing the oil price to its maximum level. https://www.amazon.com/Oil-Kings-Arabia-Changed-Balance/dp/1439155186/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1530391303&sr=8-1&keywords=the+oil+kings …"	prchovanec	7	2	1530391357	1013160903540461568	https://twitter.com/prchovanec/status/1013160903540461568

	That's not 100% true. There was a crucial point in the 1970s when the Shah of Iran kept pushing for OPEC to raise the oil price, and Saudi Arabia undercut him in order to win US favor. But it's also worth observing that the Shah probably had the market wrong anyway.	prchovanec	1	0	1530391180	1013160159370268677	https://twitter.com/prchovanec/status/1013160159370268677

	20. One last note: nobody expects the war to end this year. The current Allied plan is to launch their main offensive in 1919, when enough American troops arrive. The Germans also hope next year will bring the great victory that 1918 has not. # 100yearsago	prchovanec	11	4	1530333956	1012920145377939457	https://twitter.com/prchovanec/status/1012920145377939457		#

	19. And, looming just over the horizon: a deadly disease, influenza, is already spreading like wildfire among the troops and around the globe, carried by the movements of war. Its greatest, almost unimaginable toll is yet to come. # 100yearsago	prchovanec	8	4	1530333316	1012917463061852160	https://twitter.com/prchovanec/status/1012917463061852160		#	
	18. In other words, it's hard to even remember what the world looked like in June 1914, after four years of unimaginable war. So much has changed. # 100yearsago	prchovanec	4	2	1530333299	1012917391959916544	https://twitter.com/prchovanec/status/1012917391959916544		#	
	17. The U.S. government is taking on unprecedented powers in drafting soldiers, directing economic resources, raising war funds (via taxes and bonds), and even suppressing dissent agains the war. # 100yearsago	prchovanec	3	3	1530332787	1012915244321173505	https://twitter.com/prchovanec/status/1012915244321173505		#	
	16. In almost every country, women are taking on greater roles in the workplace, and even behind the lines on the battlefield. And calls for them to enjoy greater political influence are growing as well. # 100yearsago	prchovanec	4	2	1530332707	1012914905823969280	https://twitter.com/prchovanec/status/1012914905823969280		#	
	15. Dozens of newly independent nations, or aspiring nations, once part of pre-war European empires are looking to US President Wilson's pledge to honor national self-determination as a basis for any post-war settlement. # 100yearsago	prchovanec	4	2	1530332512	1012914089872502785	https://twitter.com/prchovanec/status/1012914089872502785		#	
	14. Finland is now independent from Russia, and its brutal civil war between Red Guards and White Guards is over (the Whites under Mannerheim won, with German help) # 100yearsago	prchovanec	6	1	1530332261	1012913036775051269	https://twitter.com/prchovanec/status/1012913036775051269		#	
	13. Meanwhile, with Russia's collapse, the Turks now dream of conquering an empire unobstructed in the Caucasus and even Central Asia. They have only just barely been halted by newly independent Georgia and Armenia. # 100yearsago	prchovanec	7	2	1530332148	1012912562663559169	https://twitter.com/prchovanec/status/1012912562663559169		#	
	12. The British have captured much of Palestine from the Turks, but further advances have stalled for the time being, with troops being diverted to hold the Western Front. # 100yearsago	prchovanec	2	1	1530332041	1012912114271444992	https://twitter.com/prchovanec/status/1012912114271444992		#	
	11. Food rationing in the U.S., Britain, and France is far easier to bear than in Germany, where hungry people are going without any meat, and even clothing is now being rationed. The German army is weakened by hunger, the Allied armies are not. # 100yearsago	prchovanec	5	1	1530331850	1012911314350559232	https://twitter.com/prchovanec/status/1012911314350559232		#	
	10. The Austrian Empire appears on the verge of a total breakdown, with starving citizens engaging in strikes and food riots, and disaffected Slavic minorities calling for full independence - a demand the Allies endorse. # 100yearsago	prchovanec	8	3	1530331651	1012910477675057152	https://twitter.com/prchovanec/status/1012910477675057152		#	
	9. Austria's latest offensive in Italy, urged by the Germans to divert Allied resources form the Western Front, has ended in disaster. # 100yearsago	prchovanec	5	2	1530331542	1012910018415521792	https://twitter.com/prchovanec/status/1012910018415521792		#	
	8. Under the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk, Germans and Austrians occupy Ukraine, Crimea, Belarus, and the Baltic - much of the Russian Empire's richest land. But growing chaos has prevented them from fully tapping its food supplies and other resources as they had hoped. # 100yearsago	prchovanec	6	1	1530331456	1012909661836759042	https://twitter.com/prchovanec/status/1012909661836759042		#	
	7. Russia lies in chaos, with Lenin's Bolsheviks controlling the core of Russia but facing multiple revolts in Siberia and southern Russia. The greatest immediate threat is the Czech Legion, which has seized control of the entire Trans-Siberian railroad. # 100yearsago	prchovanec	8	4	1530331282	1012908931197390848	https://twitter.com/prchovanec/status/1012908931197390848		#	
	6. Tanks are playing a growing role in combat on the Western Front, on both sides, though they remain primitive, slow, and unreliable. # 100yearsago	prchovanec	4	2	1530331042	1012907922853154817	https://twitter.com/prchovanec/status/1012907922853154817		#	
	5. Aircraft are waging war in the skies over the Western Front like never before, with bombing raids hitting Paris and German cities. But the days when German fighter aces, like the (late) Red Baron, ruled the skies are over. # 100yearsago	prchovanec	5	4	1530330988	1012907698692730881	https://twitter.com/prchovanec/status/1012907698692730881		#	
	4. German u-boats still terrorize the Atlantic, but have not stopped US troops and supplies from reaching Europe. Germany's great gamble on using the submarine to win the war has failed. # 100yearsago	prchovanec	6	3	1530330868	1012907192410935296	https://twitter.com/prchovanec/status/1012907192410935296		#	
	3. US troops are now flooding into France by the thousands every day, filling growing stretches of the Western Front, with hundreds of thousands more on their way. The tide in manpower on the Western Front has turned. # 100yearsago	prchovanec	8	4	1530330766	1012906766345129984	https://twitter.com/prchovanec/status/1012906766345129984		#	
	2. Germany's great Spring Offensive, swinging all its strength to the Western Front for a breakthrough victory before enough American troops can arrive in Europe, has essentially failed.

	But You're dam sure not raising rates when 2nd largest CB has turned rates into a joke with zero forever BS. You want to fix yield curve. Make ECB hike by force now. Or hikes are over.

	If the fed wants to keep raising rates and not destroy banks. I have an easy solution and yield curve will not invert. Call German.
