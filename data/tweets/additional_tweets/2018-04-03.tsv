	Maybe you’re right. If we can’t even communicate via Twitter, stellar civilizations have no hope .	naval	6	0	1522751971	981118997104963584	https://twitter.com/naval/status/981118997104963584

	Photoids were also created for the plot. The whole thing was set up to make Dark Forest unusually likely. My only point was that it’s not as inevitable in reality as he makes it out in his novels.	naval	2	0	1522751285	981116117069438976	https://twitter.com/naval/status/981116117069438976			
	Positing that it’s easier to destroy a civilization (with no threat of second-strike retaliation) than to communicate with it, is a massive contrivance.	naval	1	0	1522751158	981115583503585281	https://twitter.com/naval/status/981115583503585281			
	Liu set up physics and tech in his system to make Dark Forest more plausible. But even in his setup, tossing photoids at first contact is stupid because of civs potentially having hidden second strike capabilities.	naval	3	0	1522750466	981112683272392704	https://twitter.com/naval/status/981112683272392704			
	It was contrived for the plot. Note the sophons allowed long distance communication via quantum entanglement. Liu set up his physics and technology to make Dark Forest more plausible.	naval	1	0	1522750322	981112080282542080	https://twitter.com/naval/status/981112080282542080

	Long before you have the power to destroy a remote civ, you have the power to destroy your own. So each civ has to tame itself to live long enough to be a threat to others. Which implies that powerful survivors are rational pacifists with second-strike capabilities.	naval	28	5	1522728403	981020143974105090	https://twitter.com/naval/status/981020143974105090			
	Yup, same as on earth today. There’s the rub. That’s why if I had to assign probabilities, I would guess that all civilizations self destruct after a certain progress level.	naval	9	0	1522728245	981019483031547904	https://twitter.com/naval/status/981019483031547904			
	Yup, there’s wireheading, simulation hypothesis, self-destruction, vast distances, benevolent observers, apathy, dark forest, etc. All are possible.	naval	1	0	1522728129	981018995737354240	https://twitter.com/naval/status/981018995737354240			
	Defenders would broadcast Doomsday / MAD capability, pledge no first-strike, and promise open-source tech transfer and trade to cooperators. Encourage communication over first strikes.

	MAD can work without attribution. See Dr. Strangelove. I.e., if you take me out, I take out the neighborhood. Which then takes out all adjacent neighborhoods. And so on.

	Liu only followed the game theory partway to create a good plot device. Followed fully, the universe would be full of hidden nuclear submarines.

	Agreed but humans cooperate across their species’ genetic boundaries. An advanced life form may be able to cooperate with other advanced life forms.

bitcoin 	False imo. Satoshi compared Bitcoin to gold (a settlement layer, not a payment mechanism) on 6 separate occasions, and Hal Finney in '10 described the architecture of payments layer built on top of the main chain settlement layer.

bitcoin 	Imo virtue signaling by altcoin proponents that one cares about small tx for the unbanked is usually a straw man interpretation of the bitcoiner's argument that value anchor layer (suitable for large tx settlement) is a necessary prerequisite for payment focused protocol layers.

	There is a crucially important need people have to securely save for future needs instead of spending instantly or going into debt which brings its own raft of problems, personally & for the wider economy. It's a much weaker point if it's a pile of inflationary fiat currency.	NickSzabo4	9	3	1522791962	981286729930780673	https://twitter.com/NickSzabo4/status/981286729930780673			
	"Display of wealth and store of wealth are very far from being mutually exclusive uses of an object in most cultures. Modern Western culture makes a very sharp dichotomy between ""money"" and ""jewelry"" but that is our culture, not the historical cultural norm."

	For SoV purposes it doesn't matter that their monetary metals were in some other form besides coins (as indeed most monetary metals were for most of their history).	NickSzabo4	0	0	1522789849	981277869119717376	https://twitter.com/NickSzabo4/status/981277869119717376			
	Thanks. It's silly ideology to pretend that use of gold as SoV started in 600 BC with the invention of coins, when the archaeological record of its use dates back to at least 4600BC, and use of gold jewelry as SoV continues in many cultures to this day.

	"The Inca used a number of collectibles as stores of value and media of wealth transfer, including ""ceremonial"" textiles and monetary metals. The conquistadors weren't looting strings with knots."

	Indeed, what works well in a family or small group usually scales extremely poorly, and often produces horrible consequences when attempts are made to apply to wider society.	NickSzabo4	8	0	1522769252	981191478134292480	https://twitter.com/NickSzabo4/status/981191478134292480

	These collectibles were, therefore, trust-minimized. Their transfer across so many groups of people that couldn't be reliably trusted couldn't have been based on unsecured credit. & the most common (shells & monetary metals) have the design characteristics of trust minimization.	NickSzabo4	2	0	1522768707	981189190506364929	https://twitter.com/NickSzabo4/status/981189190506364929			
	Yes. The natural unaided ability to form reliable trust relationships is limited to about 150 people (the Dunbar number). Archaeological record of preliterate societies records travel of collectibles, of kind later observed as SoV/MoWT, across territories of 10,000s of people.

	"Store of value. One of the economist's attributes of money. Be careful: many scholars use very narrow definitions of ""money"" that exclude tons of things that serve(d) as stores of value, media of exchange or wealth transfer, and/or units of account, Graeber among them."

	No. Human memories aren't reliable or trustworthy enough to serve, unaided by later technologies and institutions, as cross-clan records. Clans typically not only distrusted each other, they bloodily fought each other.	NickSzabo4	11	0	1522765432	981175456064970752	https://twitter.com/NickSzabo4/status/981175456064970752			
	If they (and you) read up on what travelers, missionaries, & ethnographers actually witnessed & recorded of recently contacted cultures, you will find that SoV & medium of wealth transfer long preceded record-keeping.

	How utterly stupid to assume that in the absence of information, that a businessman has the risks handled properly.

	I'm quite aware of tricks to mitigate 0-conf risks. The arguments coming from the CEO give me no confidence that he does.

	I can't tell if you're being sarcastic.

bitcoin 	Afterall, Bitcoin is safe based upon kind of probability, and 0-conf is no safer than Bitcoin itself, honestly discussion about the risk with it will not hinder its development and adoption, but only make it more acceptable and more widely used.

bitcoin 	I agree. After all, SoE is an ingrained mindset. And I believe bitcoin will be world's reserve asset. An excellent one.

	The mistake was believing that something whose value is actually a social construct based on its earlier evolution as a record-keeping device had some innate physical value.
