bitcoin 	Yes, it's true that zero conf is safe for many many use cases. No, that does not mean that we should rely on it absolutely, and ignore tech (bitcoin NG, GHOST, etc) that can give us *actual confirmations* within a few seconds.

	This whole zero-conf stuff is definitely one of my sources of disagreement with most BCH people.	VitalikButerin	18	3	1522851136	981534922602000384	https://twitter.com/VitalikButerin/status/981534922602000384			
	Particularly, if a user sends out two txs spending the same UTXO at the same time, then different nodes will have different opinions on what is a double spend, leading to high probability of stale block (this is also exploitable for selfish mining).

	Wait, wow? CSW is actually proposing making not including double spends as perceived by a given node a consensus rule? I'm guessing it would be overridable by two confirmations, but still, that seems extremely risky.

	If you can solve NP-hard problems, you can break discrete log (but for the discrete log use case, approximate solutions are NOT good enough)	VitalikButerin	8	3	1522809581	981360630849392641	https://twitter.com/VitalikButerin/status/981360630849392641			
	I *believe* he's arguing that optimal pathfinding on the LN is NP-hard, because it's a traveling salesman problem (and even that isn't true; it's pathfinding, which is solvable in poly time). Even for TSP, poly-time heuristics are absolutely good enough.	VitalikButerin	8	2	1522809529	981360409243303936	https://twitter.com/VitalikButerin/status/981360409243303936

	The blog post describes some techniques for detecting it. I'll say this: SM has been deployed in practice, on an altcoin. My lips are sealed beyond that. I'd like to move on.

	I'm just as flummoxed about why CSW is so hung up on SM. There was absolutely no reason to bring up SM right now, because no one is currently engaged in it AFAIK.

	My view is that banks focus on banking-as-usual, cheaper and faster with technology. They need to rethink their whole business with technology, and learn from leaders like Ant Financial # OracleChat	Chris_Skinner	1	0	1522861151	981576927910776832	https://twitter.com/Chris_Skinner/status/981576927910776832		#	
	Cleansed, enterprise data architectures with a single view of the customer with super-charged AI is the core for a bank that survives in the future # OracleChat	Chris_Skinner	2	0	1522861093	981576687384178688	https://twitter.com/Chris_Skinner/status/981576687384178688		#

	Banks will work down the value chain towards the MNO models, as MNOs work their way up. We'll create hybrid Telco-Banks # Oraclechat	Chris_Skinner	1	0	1522861007	981576324903993344	https://twitter.com/Chris_Skinner/status/981576324903993344		#	
	I claim that most US and EU banks are run by old men ... need diversity in the boardroom. Not just more women but younger people. Most FinTech Unicorns (Venmo, Stripe, Square, etc) created by folks in their 20's. Where are those people in the bank's leadership teams? # OracleChat	Chris_Skinner	2	0	1522860880	981575793896771585	https://twitter.com/Chris_Skinner/status/981575793896771585		#	
	If we'd said to our grandfathers that only 1 in 100 of them would work on a farm today, they'd have jumped off a cliff # OracleChat	Chris_Skinner	1	0	1522860762	981575297450610688	https://twitter.com/Chris_Skinner/status/981575297450610688		#	
	Another good stat is that digital leaders make 1 in 4 sales through digital access (no channels here), not just revenues # OracleChat	Chris_Skinner	0	0	1522860719	981575118831980544	https://twitter.com/Chris_Skinner/status/981575118831980544		#	
	Read Digital Human for the complete answer, as it talks a lot about AI and robots and then the jobs of the future https://www.amazon.com/Digital-Human-Revolution-Humanity-Everyone/dp/1119511852/ref=oosr … # OracleChat	Chris_Skinner	1	0	1522860679	981574951957417990	https://twitter.com/Chris_Skinner/status/981574951957417990		#	
	Equally, many of tomorrow’s jobs haven’t been invented yet, so not worried about this # OracleChat	Chris_Skinner	1	0	1522860647	981574817068519424	https://twitter.com/Chris_Skinner/status/981574817068519424		#	
	But that doesn’t mean the end of banking jobs, as there will be other jobs. Jobs in FinTech, Blockchain and AI have blossomed in the last five years for example # OracleChat	Chris_Skinner	1	0	1522860611	981574664957947904	https://twitter.com/Chris_Skinner/status/981574664957947904		#

	Third is being flexible and adaptable, as many of today’s technologies may easily be obsolete in under five years. Think like a start-up # OracleChat	Chris_Skinner	1	0	1522860469	981574067378642944	https://twitter.com/Chris_Skinner/status/981574067378642944		#	
	Second would be maintaining the momentum, as digital is a journey that continues relentlessly, and can often get frozen by the middle management # OracleChat	Chris_Skinner	2	0	1522860424	981573879536775174	https://twitter.com/Chris_Skinner/status/981573879536775174		#

	Total management commitment from the C-Team for total business transformation, as most don’t get what digital is, as just mentioned # OracleChat	Chris_Skinner	1	0	1522860333	981573496881991680	https://twitter.com/Chris_Skinner/status/981573496881991680		#	
	94% of banks are led by bankers who have no tech experience. How can they create a digital bank that's tech-led with no tech people on the leadership team? # OracleChat	Chris_Skinner	0	0	1522860305	981573380943089664	https://twitter.com/Chris_Skinner/status/981573380943089664		#	
	They need to read a book I can strongly recommend https://www.amazon.com/Digital-Human-Revolution-Humanity-Everyone/dp/1119511852/ref=oosr … ... it's all about the new business model of finance # OracleChat	Chris_Skinner	2	0	1522860097	981572508875939842	https://twitter.com/Chris_Skinner/status/981572508875939842		#

	But has it left it too late? Most banks finding that holding back the years is like holding back the oceans, and King Canute couldn’t do that so neither will the banks # OracleChat	Chris_Skinner	2	0	1522859334	981569308856913920	https://twitter.com/Chris_Skinner/status/981569308856913920		#	
	For banks like Deutsche Bank, that really only committed to digital change at start of 2017, they’re 8 YEARS behind banks like DBS # OracleChat but at least they're now committed too	Chris_Skinner	1	0	1522859292	981569132654137344	https://twitter.com/Chris_Skinner/status/981569132654137344		#	
	But when I point to the leading digitally transforming banks like DBS, they started in 2009 and can now clearly demonstrate results https://thefinanser.com/2017/11/proving-digital-transformation-works-shareholder-returns.html/ … # OracleChat	Chris_Skinner	3	0	1522859235	981568891414634496	https://twitter.com/Chris_Skinner/status/981568891414634496		#	
	I think most big FSIs are now doing things and moving in the right direction, not holding back so much. Just taken them a helluva long time # OracleChat	Chris_Skinner	2	0	1522859171	981568626787586049	https://twitter.com/Chris_Skinner/status/981568626787586049		#	
	More important to ask: are companies still holding back? # OracleChat	Chris_Skinner	1	0	1522859126	981568434264793089	https://twitter.com/Chris_Skinner/status/981568434264793089		#

	But the best # finserv of all is a tech firm called Ant Financial who produce 35x more value than banks like Barclays (watch this video to see why https://thefinanser.com/2018/04/digital-banks-35-times-productive-traditional-banks.html/ …) # OracleChat	Chris_Skinner	3	0	1522858770	981566943298760705	https://twitter.com/Chris_Skinner/status/981566943298760705		# #

	I've long said China has no interest in free trade, markets, or investment and honestly, I've been proven right. This seems to indicate Beijing warning Trump back down now or we will go hard, because we are not opening. Speculative of course as hot take but matches.

	3. My guess is that Beijing is effectively trying draw a line in the sand or warn Trump that they will fight hard, dirty, or twist the knife. It also seems to telegraph the intent, they plan on giving up nothing. US and China list seem drawn up with very different intent. 4/n	BaldingsWorld	22	5	1522831900	981454242513870848	https://twitter.com/BaldingsWorld/status/981454242513870848			
	2. Even though the numbers are comparable, China seems to pretty clearly be hitting out harder and trying to inflict more pain than Trump. That is notable. Which leads to point #3 about my guess on how to interpret points #1 & 2. Warning: speculative. 3/n	BaldingsWorld	18	5	1522831773	981453709086461953	https://twitter.com/BaldingsWorld/status/981453709086461953		#3 #1	
	seems relatively concentrated with a little over 100 items. That's strikingly different approach and intent.
