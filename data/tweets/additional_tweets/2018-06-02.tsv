	My original tweet had omniscience and omnipotence but they wouldn’t both fit. Count the characters on my tweet, I used every single one. Most people’s definition of a God includes omnipotence.

	To an atheist, it’s all particle collisions since Big Bang. To a theist, omniscient God knows everything. Free will requires a limited God, a contradiction.

	Judgement is making decisions. Leverage magnifies the consequences of those decisions. Invest $100 of your money or $10,000 of someone else’s.

ethereum 	Not entirely correct. You did not own and could not trade ETH after its ICO for a good year, until the network was turned ON first. They proved Ethereum's utility first.	wmougayar	2	1	1527968913	1003000437086224384	https://twitter.com/wmougayar/status/1003000437086224384			
	Words getting abused, misused, overused, and confused today in the blockchain lexicon: . ICOs . Security token . Utility token . Stake token . Governance . Foundation .

	There are ICOs and ICOs. Not all ICOs are the same. A quality team will do a good ICO. Bad ICOs get the rest.	wmougayar	9	1	1527968130	1002997150266134529	https://twitter.com/wmougayar/status/1002997150266134529			
	"Are we calling some tokens ""security tokens"" to fit with securities regulation, or because they are really securities? Eventually, all tokens are destined to have a utility function. Being a security token is a transient state, a right of passage to meet a compliance requirement."	wmougayar	81	25	1527967946	1002996379160055810	https://twitter.com/wmougayar/status/1002996379160055810			
	It depends. When big companies used the Web, did it really change their business? Rather, the new Web companies changed our lives and ways of doing business.	wmougayar	0	0	1527967214	1002993311571955713	https://twitter.com/wmougayar/status/1002993311571955713			
	But it's not just about the database. The blockchain disrupts money, business models, and law; 3 significant fields.	wmougayar	2	0	1527960083	1002963399016439808	https://twitter.com/wmougayar/status/1002963399016439808			
	To what extent are incumbents needed to help us get to this new world of blockchain? Blockchains are threatening and challenging incumbents much earlier than the Internet did. The early Web days were relatively harmless, whereas the blockchain is a more cunning technology.	wmougayar	23	6	1527959029	1002958980656885762	https://twitter.com/wmougayar/status/1002958980656885762

	Visions of the blockchain future which remove transparency solve a different problem: the rights of the individual. These systems can exist, but only inside of hard limits about the resource inputs to those secret systems. Overall network consumption can and must be priced.	leashless	21	6	1527902033	1002719922215153664	https://twitter.com/leashless/status/1002719922215153664			
	The point is to gather in all the externalities, all the consequences, into a shared global economic map. Then, on this map, future policy can be simulated and tested until you find the mechanisms which generate the desired outcomes. Then iterate. Incentives *can* work.

	You need clear eyes to see the future, and an ambition as big as the sky (as big as justice) to not flinch from the darkness which plagues so many possible timelines. You can't fix this mess with efficient markets with underpriced externalities. That's just murder without a name	leashless	42	11	1527901599	1002718099102228480	https://twitter.com/leashless/status/1002718099102228480			
	The blockchain is for building the next economy: correctly price externalities, and count every dropped grain of rice. Levy economic taxes to foster and force radical resource efficiency.

	The current economy, for all its productivity, is too inefficient. 50% food waste on a planet of starving people. Orphan drugs and orphan diseases. Deforestation. Sea plastic. All of that comes from mispricing assets and measuring the wrong things. Accept no smaller challenge.	leashless	68	22	1527901332	1002716982339350528	https://twitter.com/leashless/status/1002716982339350528			
	We are going to need to be much, much smarter about this blockchain thing. It's not clear to people that we are building tools to manage scarce planetary resources through the difficult 21st century. They think it's just an extension of the current economy.

	Some things truly are coincidences. I don't think Trump has had much to do with oil prices.
