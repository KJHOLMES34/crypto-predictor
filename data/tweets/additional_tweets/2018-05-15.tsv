	11/ Any suggestions on a good objective metric that fairly measures whether a non-money blockchain project gets traction would be great. In the meantime, I had a great time and regardless of how the bet goes, I would love to do a panel in 2023 with Joe Lubin. /fin	jimmysong	143	3	1526360339	996253586307911680	https://twitter.com/jimmysong/status/996253586307911680			
	10/ He realizes just as I do, that there's no easy way to measure if a blockchain project actually has users. Especially a measurement that's not easily game-able.	jimmysong	83	4	1526360247	996253203195973633	https://twitter.com/jimmysong/status/996253203195973633			
bitcoin 	"9/ Regarding my bet with Joe, I'll have to think about this, but the thing he said right before he said ""I'll bet you any amount of bitcoin that you're wrong"" is ""Assuming we can come up with a good standard"" or something like that."	jimmysong	66	2	1526360136	996252735187111936	https://twitter.com/jimmysong/status/996252735187111936			
ethereum 	8/ Anyway, I definitely wore the black hat today voiced my doubts about this tech. I want to thank @ ethereumJoseph and @ AmberBaldet for being good sports about this. I've already seen 2 articles on our panel and I'm sure there will be more.	jimmysong	112	1	1526360064	996252435843813376	https://twitter.com/jimmysong/status/996252435843813376			@ @
	7/ Giving voice to something that you know is true often results in shock and laughter. That's what I saw. The entire crowd had been eating non-stop stories about how everything was going to change for the better because of the new tech, usually sponsored by a panelist.	jimmysong	130	4	1526359984	996252098357616640	https://twitter.com/jimmysong/status/996252098357616640			
	6/ But because so many people are new, or because they're not confident in their assessment of what was just shown, they think they're missing something. And so they politely clap and ignore the nagging doubts in their mind.	jimmysong	133	3	1526359896	996251730248642562	https://twitter.com/jimmysong/status/996251730248642562			
	5/ What I said wasn't anything special. I verbalized what probably a large amount of the people in the audience were thinking and much of the reaction in the room was indicating that they, too, didn't get anything of substance from the presentation.	jimmysong	132	1	1526359836	996251479546658816	https://twitter.com/jimmysong/status/996251479546658816			
	"4/ The thing I said that got everything started was just the frustration with vague decks that have very little technical detail. Granted, you have a general audience, but come on, you have to provide a bit more detail than ""we'll fix everything""."	jimmysong	156	7	1526359746	996251102533255170	https://twitter.com/jimmysong/status/996251102533255170			
	3/ I enjoyed my interviews with CoinDesk and Cheddar, but I'm sure the big one was the one on stage. I've spoken at conferences before, but the reaction to this one was pretty dramatic and more than I expected.	jimmysong	84	2	1526359685	996250845560934400	https://twitter.com/jimmysong/status/996250845560934400			
	2/ I really wish consensus was a bit better organized, though, as the wait in line was just absolutely insane. So many people ended up waiting for over an hour to get their badge. They desperately needed more staff today.	jimmysong	81	1	1526359596	996250472817274880	https://twitter.com/jimmysong/status/996250472817274880			
	1/ Some thoughts on what went on today. First, as much as I complain about these conferences, it's really great to see people that I haven't seen in a while. The beauty of a big conference like this is that you can go hang out with people you want to hang out with.	jimmysong	422	66	1526359516	996250135041576960	https://twitter.com/jimmysong/status/996250135041576960

	Centralized digital services, whether in traditional finance or in the crypto biz, are extremely vulnerable to local lawsuits and political pressure.

	Currently unanticipated steps, not centrally planned steps. Also, for a step to be viable it must pay for itself in terms of benefits to the people paying for it (this usually means a profitable business or military security; for very small steps can also be scientific benefits).

	For non-CS people: Lamport already provided a solution in the same paper that introduced the problem. He has a well deserved Turing award.

	All true, and in line with my quote. BTW, rewriting of that kind takes time proportional to amount being overwritten and surplus hashpower over 50%.

	Somehow HN picked up this column though, and the usual descent into madness took place, where no words mean what they should and everyone spouts random phrases.

	This is not the Byzantine Generals Problem. Proof-of-Work is far from the only solution to it.

	ICO worst case: - Sometimes $1-5m per exchange, and you want multiple exchanges - attorney fees and rulings - wallet and payment processor listing fees, $250k-1m each - marketers and investment bankers that take a huge slice of tokens, off and worth millions themselves	jgarzik	1	0	1526338406	996161592315301888	https://twitter.com/jgarzik/status/996161592315301888

	14. Trotsky (in charge of the Red Army) responded by declaring them in revolt and revoking their safe passage. The Czech Legion, spread across vital rail junctions across Russia, was now at war with the Soviet government. # 100yearsago	prchovanec	12	2	1526406611	996447667621453824	https://twitter.com/prchovanec/status/996447667621453824		#	
	13. When local Soviet authorities tried to arrest the Czech soldiers, they resisted and took control of the town. As they were spread all along the route, as word spread they quickly began to seize control of the entire Trans-Siberian railroad from west to east. # 100yearsago	prchovanec	6	2	1526406504	996447216435978240	https://twitter.com/prchovanec/status/996447216435978240		#	
	12. On May 14, 1918 two trains were stopped side-by-side at Chelyabinsk, in Siberia: one carrying Czech Legion soldiers east, the other carrying Hungarian POWs west. A scuffle broke out and men on both sides were killed. # 100yearsago	prchovanec	6	2	1526406360	996446613672480768	https://twitter.com/prchovanec/status/996446613672480768		#	
	11. It was a confusing situation: some feared the Reds were German puppets, while others feared the Whites were German puppets. Everyone was scared that the Germans, one way or another, would end up taking over all of Russia. # 100yearsago	prchovanec	4	3	1526406218	996446017229901825	https://twitter.com/prchovanec/status/996446017229901825		#	
	10. Reports of up to 200,000 German and Austrian POWs being released and re-armed throughout Russia also seriously alarmed the Allies, and played a key role in prompting Japanese, British, and eventually American intervention in the Russian Civil War. # 100yearsago	prchovanec	4	2	1526406060	996445354215264257	https://twitter.com/prchovanec/status/996445354215264257		#	
	9. As they moved east, however, the Bolsheviks put pressure on many of them to join the Red Army. They also encountered thousands of former German and Austro-Hungarian POWs armed by the Bolsheviks to fight on their side, men who the Czechs saw as their enemies. # 100yearsago	prchovanec	4	0	1526405897	996444673945292801	https://twitter.com/prchovanec/status/996444673945292801		#	
	8. Lenin then granted the Czech Legion safe passage to be transported east (without surrendering their arms) along the Trans-Siberian Railroad to Vladivostok, where they could be taken by ship to rejoin the Allies fighting on the Western Front # 100yearsago	prchovanec	3	0	1526405694	996443819758489600	https://twitter.com/prchovanec/status/996443819758489600		#	
	7. German forces advancing into Ukraine tried to capture the Czechs, but they successfully fought their way out at the Battle of Bakhmach, just east of Kiev. # 100yearsago	prchovanec	3	1	1526405544	996443191195906049	https://twitter.com/prchovanec/status/996443191195906049		#	
	6. The soldiers of the Czech Legion knew that if they were returned to Austria, under the Brest-Litovsk peace treaty, they would almost certainly be shot as deserters and traitors. # 100yearsago	prchovanec	2	0	1526405459	996442835162468354	https://twitter.com/prchovanec/status/996442835162468354		#	
	5. When the Bolshevik Revolution happened (in November 1917), and an armistice was declared on the Eastern Front, the Czech Legion found themselves stranded in Ukraine amid an increasingly chaotic and hazardous political environment. # 100yearsago	prchovanec	1	1	1526405363	996442433008390144	https://twitter.com/prchovanec/status/996442433008390144		#	
	4. Eventually, the Czech Legion were made formally part of the French Army, though they were fighting in Russia (and were one of the most effective units in the Brusilov and Kerensky offensives) # 100yearsago	prchovanec	2	1	1526405253	996441971265867776	https://twitter.com/prchovanec/status/996441971265867776		#	
	3. Despite efforts by the Tsarist government to control it, the Czech Legion's loyalties lay with expatriate leaders in London who hoped that, by fighting on the Allied side, Czechs and Slovaks could secure independence at the peace table when the Allies won. # 100yearsago	prchovanec	4	0	1526405158	996441574052646912	https://twitter.com/prchovanec/status/996441574052646912		#	
	2. The Czech Legion was formed in Russia from Czech soldiers who either were living in Russia, defected from the Austrian Army, or were captured on the Eastern Front and joined up. # 100yearsago	prchovanec	2	0	1526405034	996441053707341824	https://twitter.com/prchovanec/status/996441053707341824		#

	No. I think you should have to show ID to vote. (Not because of fraud, because I think voting should be an act of intention.) Always have.
