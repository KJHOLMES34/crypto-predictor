	Crypto is like any extreme sport - more pleasure than you can ever hope to experience and more pain than you can ever hope to avoid . When the pleasure is not euphoric, it hasn’t peaked yet and when the pain is not debilitating, then it hasn’t bottomed out yet either...

	They wouldn’t do that unless the price of BTC dropped below a point that was marginally profitable for them. They only supported Core because it put food on the table for them.

	The only real risk is if the price goes below $3k and miners leave or sell their hashpower to a third party, exposing a real risk of a 51% attack. The “game theory” that created a second major SHA256 chain may backfire in that case and we would then have 3 chains of significance!https://twitter.com/cointelegraph/status/1007094282900131840 …	VinnyLingham	122	27	1528945409	1007096159272177665	https://twitter.com/VinnyLingham/status/1007096159272177665

	Indeed, PoS is the mechanism for selecting, or weeding out, members. To be super precise, the protocols need to still decide on staking txs to ensure all members are in sync. PBFT/Tendermint/etc/Avalanche are the protocols for deciding on transactions, not PoS.	el33th4xor	5	0	1528978789	1007236163462021121	https://twitter.com/el33th4xor/status/1007236163462021121

	PoS+longest chain does not yield a correct system. Longest chain only works if the rate at which the tail is expanded exceeds the rate at which forks can be expanded.
