	It depends on whether you interpret 'egg' in the question as 'chicken egg' or 'any egg'. If the latter, obviously eggs came first.	VitalikButerin	32	6	1527019178	999016959164502016	https://twitter.com/VitalikButerin/status/999016959164502016

	But the omnipotence of god is not a universal law, it's a property of an entity at time T. I don't think 'irrevocable omnipotence' is worth talking about because for reasons seen above it's not even logically coherent.

	Nope! Kings are free to abdicate, and indeed I would say a monarch without the power to abdicate is not an absolute monarch.

	But if he could do that, then that means he *does* have a way of lifting the rock after all. Because God is omnipotent, it must be possible for him to create a rock he cannot lift. Ergo once created the rock's unliftability is irrevocable.	VitalikButerin	39	2	1526951647	998733715449794560	https://twitter.com/VitalikButerin/status/998733715449794560			
	"There are possible worlds where it is not. For example, suppose chickens are unisex and self-fertilize eggs, and most genetic mutation happens *around birth*. Then, the first adult chicken likely came before the first chicken egg, at least for any genetic definition of ""chicken""."

	Oh I did not say he *is* not omnipotent. I said that *by making the rock* he makes himself *no longer* omnipotent. He's still omnipotent at the present time.	VitalikButerin	36	3	1526951222	998731930786025472	https://twitter.com/VitalikButerin/status/998731930786025472			
	You'd have to pick some genetic dividing line to distinguish chicken vs non-chicken. Since as I understand most genetic rearranging happens at conception, it's likely the first chicken egg came before the first adult chicken. Biologists feel free to correct me though.

	"Reminder: the correct resolution to the ""can an omnipotent god make a rock so heavy that even he cannot lift it?"" paradox is: yes, he can, but as soon as the rock is created he will no longer be omnipotent, he'll be 'omnipotent except for that darn rock' Now you know."

bitcoin 	On another note, one could argue that DAA may have to be age-weighted (e.g. a long term holder moving coins may be more significant than a darknet market buyer tx). @ UnchainedCap recently published research on address age:https://blog.unchained-capital.com/bitcoin-data-science-pt-1-hodl-waves-7f3501d53f63 …	TuurDemeester	40	13	1527010290	998979681562087425	https://twitter.com/TuurDemeester/status/998979681562087425			@

	The challenge with using Daily Active Addresses in a valuation equation, is that there's a natural upper bound because of the block size limit.

	Not sure why u threw DCR into this. DCR has an uncorrelated chart.

	Accumulation phase refers to when price flattens horizontal line for a long period, you see it from the shape of the price chart, not volatility. Volatility refers to how smooth the line is, and that can happen in the mania phase going up (but never in the crash going down).	woonomic	11	1	1527003160	998949775595753477	https://twitter.com/woonomic/status/998949775595753477			
	"I said we bottomed yes, for that multi-month phase, not in perpetuity. Who calls stuff forever?

	Pretty sure 8000 support on BTCUSD is gonna fail. Next support, low 7000s (though that could fail too).

	Second, Chinese is a VERY tonal language. To someone that doesn't know what this mean let me try this analogy.

	First, Chinese is an astoundingly hard language. It isn't just me but research that says so.

	It would be more correct, in a money economy, to say that to demand is to convince people that you can supply, sooner or later.	prchovanec	0	0	1527001359	998942221767532544	https://twitter.com/prchovanec/status/998942221767532544

	So the money supply can shrink or grow without the Fed changing a thing. Credit can expand to create current claims that don’t necessarily reflect current output or capacity.	prchovanec	0	0	1527001112	998941183794663426	https://twitter.com/prchovanec/status/998941183794663426			
	Also, keep in mind that broad money supply depends as much or more on the multiplier and velocity than on the base money supply.

	For instance, say that the money supply is growing by 3% and real economy is feeling by 3%. But then there’s a resource constraint that limits non-inflationary growth to 2% - but the money supply and demand keep growing at 3%.	prchovanec	0	0	1527000880	998940212574277632	https://twitter.com/prchovanec/status/998940212574277632			
	And I’d argue that aggregate demand can outstrip aggregate supply for a variety of reasons, giving rise to more than just relative price changes.	prchovanec	0	0	1527000780	998939792439218176	https://twitter.com/prchovanec/status/998939792439218176

	Most of the “controversy” about the Laffer Curve is in regards to income taxes. I assure you that every state government, intuitively, understands that the Laffer Curve very much applies to revenue from liquor and cigarette taxes.	prchovanec	4	1	1526999154	998932970957393922	https://twitter.com/prchovanec/status/998932970957393922			
	There is often a point where taxing a certain economic activity excessively will shut it down. There is likely a point where labor constraints on the pace of growth can generate inflation. What these points are, and whether we’re at them, is a different question, worth debating.	prchovanec	13	0	1526997299	998925190712250369	https://twitter.com/prchovanec/status/998925190712250369
