	That paper showed that the oft-repeated claim that Nakamoto consensus is safe as long as 51% of the miners are honest is false. Selfish mining is widely accepted in the scientific community.

	All true, a simple poll can't capture all the subtleties. Let's get a ballpark figure for a simple, abstract scenario.	el33th4xor	0	0	1527655093	1001684178843336705	https://twitter.com/el33th4xor/status/1001684178843336705

	My hypothesis is that if the bounty were $10k, people would exploit for >$1m, but if the bounty were $100k, they wouldn't exploit below $50M. That is, I suspect the sellout multiplier is dependent on bounty amount.	el33th4xor	2	0	1527654810	1001682994141319169	https://twitter.com/el33th4xor/status/1001682994141319169			
	It was inspired by EOS, sure. But $10k is a reasonable bounty, and it's a fair question in the abstract. I'm genuinely curious about the bounty-amount-to-exploit ratio.	el33th4xor	1	0	1527654745	1001682720467161088	https://twitter.com/el33th4xor/status/1001682720467161088			
	It shifted around. At 200 votes, that was the least popular option, indicating that people who spend a lot of time on Twitter have no morals. :-)	el33th4xor	10	0	1527648106	1001654872696147968	https://twitter.com/el33th4xor/status/1001654872696147968			
	There are quite a few experts on consensus protocols! I'm by no means the only one in the field. Let's be clear: great devs can intuit secure protocols w/o a spec or proof. But it's much more satisfying to have strong specs of properties, as well as correctness proofs.	el33th4xor	2	0	1527646415	1001647779545042945	https://twitter.com/el33th4xor/status/1001647779545042945

	Crypto Rule #353: For any abstract thing you say on Twitter, there's someone who will think it's a specific, covert, coded attack on his coin and get mad at you for it.https://twitter.com/SatoshiLovesBCH/status/1001634543789576192 …	el33th4xor	44	7	1527645074	1001642158653394944	https://twitter.com/el33th4xor/status/1001642158653394944		#353	
	The coin loses value, and you profit. Money does not come from a faceless firm, or from an individual -- comes from the collective. Let's also say that it's not a coin you are invested in, so it's the out-group.	el33th4xor	2	0	1527644751	1001640800776871937	https://twitter.com/el33th4xor/status/1001640800776871937

	"Good question. Let's keep things simple and say ""no."" If things work correctly, you get nothing (except for the bounty, if you choose to disclose). There are no other externalities."	el33th4xor	0	0	1527644186	1001638431187927042	https://twitter.com/el33th4xor/status/1001638431187927042			
	That's the mechanism for making the money. The question asks for how much you'd do that. Surely, it makes no sense if you'll earn <$10k? But maybe you just like the thrill? Twitter only allowed 4 options, >$0 didn't fit.	el33th4xor	2	0	1527643673	1001636281703698433	https://twitter.com/el33th4xor/status/1001636281703698433			
	I don't get it. What does this have to do with BCH? Or any specific coin? I have colleagues who work on bug bounty design. It struck me that I knew the multiplier for myself, but not other people.

	You find a system bug that, if you used it, would make you X dollars. The bug bounty is a flat $10k. Assume you won't get caught. Above what value for X do you use the bug to make money, instead of reporting it and settling for the bounty? Be honest, genuinely curious here:	el33th4xor	42	13	1527642834	1001632762561007621	https://twitter.com/el33th4xor/status/1001632762561007621			
	Financial incentives work! The problem is, a $10k bounty can only flush out problems of magnitude 10000*mu, for some honesty multiplier mu, probably no greater than 100.	el33th4xor	1	0	1527642257	1001630339805138944	https://twitter.com/el33th4xor/status/1001630339805138944

	Q：ピカチュウとイーブイ、こだわった点は？ A：（増田さん）ハード面ではジョイコンやモンスターボールプラスを使って「ボールを投げる」というメカニズムを実現したこと。ビジュアル面では相棒のピカチュウとイーブイは「むちゃむちゃかわいいです」。開発中なので「まだまだ可愛くします！」とも。	mochi_wsj	98	70	1527649426	1001660410104180736	https://twitter.com/mochi_wsj/status/1001660410104180736

	We humans are not very interesting, compared to the sun or the miracle of water. Life is as well represented by plants as by primates, as the process goes.

	We are not very good at the material world yet, compared to nature. I've been looking at my handwriting: it's not like pixels in a perfect font flowing from my fingers on a screen.

	They probably did; AFAIK it was a small subset of miners that tried to continue the 50 BTC block reward.

	It is not self-gaslighting to argue that enthusiasm for Trump, a man who has utter disrespect for basic constitutional norms, is a sign of civic dysfunction. (I’m in Italy right now.

	Those who chide us about that are, in effect, demanding that we join in the delusion that Trump is a competent president. (Olsen compared him to Reagan. No, really.) Trump, imo, really is an accident of history, in part due to the presence of Hillary Clinton in the same race. /3	RadioFreeTom	240	32	1527700575	1001874946379796480	https://twitter.com/RadioFreeTom/status/1001874946379796480			
	I do not hold to any fantasies that Trump will be gone from office early. I keep warning Dems that their incompetence could produce a Trump win in 2020. But it is not self-gaslighting to remind everyone that Trump is, at best, representative of a plurality. /2	RadioFreeTom	219	37	1527700574	1001874942793728000	https://twitter.com/RadioFreeTom/status/1001874942793728000			
	Why is it that Trump’s intellectual explainers do not understand a simple thing: many Never Trumpers *get it* that Trump is popular. So’s junk food. So’s reality TV.
