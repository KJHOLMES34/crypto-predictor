ethereum 	Here's the script: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ethereum/genesis_block_generator/master/mk_genesis_block.py … Doesn't work anymore because many block explorers have shut down, but you get the idea.

	Ultimately the best place to implement any needed KYC/AML verification is at time of sale, ideally in the sale contract itself.	VitalikButerin	48	5	1528691695	1006032002900869121	https://twitter.com/VitalikButerin/status/1006032002900869121			
	The point isn't anarchy, the point is decentralization of the protocol itself, setting the precedent that the primary developer's powers are limited even starting from the launch process itself.

ethereum 	The 50k also doesn't prove data availability.

ethereum 	In fact, you can do even better. A script to calculate the genesis block is released *at time of sale*, and it's agreed that an ethereum block hash with a height that's a multiple of 500000 is needed as a nonce. The developer just writes software, community launches when ready.	VitalikButerin	131	9	1528690764	1006028096808472576	https://twitter.com/VitalikButerin/status/1006028096808472576			
ethereum 	This seems backwards. Why can't third parties just run a script to scan the BTC/ETH blockchains, see how much everyone contributed, calculate how much XTZ everyone should get, and generate the genesis block without Tezos Co involvement? That's how the Ethereum launch worked.	VitalikButerin	730	114	1528690446	1006026764341014530	https://twitter.com/VitalikButerin/status/1006026764341014530

bitcoin ripple 	It’s also fair to note that we don’t know how much Bitcoin or ETH somebody like Coinbase holds. The people behind Coinbase could hold a majority of both and we have no way to know.

ripple 	Every month, there is a set amount released. It’s not sold on the open market. Ripple can use it to for strategic partnerships if they are available. If not, whatever isn’t used is put back into another escrow at the end of the month. (2/2)	haydentiff	2	0	1528747133	1006264527070072838	https://twitter.com/haydentiff/status/1006264527070072838			
ripple 	Well, another way to look at this is that Ripple has more skin in the game than anybody else. When XRP increases just one penny, Ripple earns $600 MILLION. They have more drive to create value than anyone. Also, because others share your concern, XRP was placed in escrow.

	Bag holders know deep down that they're holding bags. You can tell because they don't want to bet. They know they just have some lottery tickets that they're hoping to hit while telling everyone that it's the next big thing.	jimmysong	249	31	1528712593	1006119656304857089	https://twitter.com/jimmysong/status/1006119656304857089			
	I frankly don't care what you think of btc. You accused me of being blind to the wonderful stuff coming out of the broader ecosystem. You refused to back up your words with a bet.	jimmysong	29	1	1528678252	1005975618729758728	https://twitter.com/jimmysong/status/1005975618729758728

	I'm not saying you're anti-BTC. I'm suggesting that if you think I'm wrong about what's going on outside BTC, that we bet about it. BTC happens to be what every investment in our industry is measured against.	jimmysong	14	1	1528670423	1005942780487700480	https://twitter.com/jimmysong/status/1005942780487700480			
	I'll tell you what @ NTmoney, why don't we do this. You pick 5 companies/ICOs/whatever cryptoassets you want vs BTC. I'll bet that BTC will do better over 5 years than whatever you pick. Can be your investments.	jimmysong	37	3	1528668973	1005936701188071425	https://twitter.com/jimmysong/status/1005936701188071425			@
	I've criticized Satoshi's code before (watch my vid with matt from this past week). This isn't elitist BS. I'm pointing out that he doesn't have much in the way of BTC contributions and the little that he did wasn't very good.	jimmysong	16	1	1528668774	1005935867469422592	https://twitter.com/jimmysong/status/1005935867469422592			
	Funny how you seem so convinced of this after saying this above. Could it be that you're the one that's caught up in your investments to recognize that most of these projects have done nothing useful?https://twitter.com/NTmoney/status/1005917473185542144 …	jimmysong	7	2	1528668224	1005933557443907587	https://twitter.com/jimmysong/status/1005933557443907587			
	8/ What's really sad is that there is a lot of wasted effort due to greed. In a sense, the current downtrend needs to continue so greed isn't rewarded.

	"Serious question: Since EOS is the ""governed blockchain,"" and since theft goes against their constitution, will they take these coins away from the thief? The users can argue that, based on the materials produced by the devs, they had an expectation that they'd be made whole.https://twitter.com/chrismalmo/status/1006273391685402629 …"	el33th4xor	46	8	1528753955	1006293140372951043	https://twitter.com/el33th4xor/status/1006293140372951043			
	I don't know. I don't believe anyone technical pays any attention to Faketoshi. But he did send a press release announcing that Ayre's miners, which are tiny, would enact his broken idea. Of course, he had said and retracted a lot of things in the past.	el33th4xor	0	0	1528742364	1006244524883107842	https://twitter.com/el33th4xor/status/1006244524883107842			
	Right now, 0-conf is useful for small to medium payments, because the miners aren't malicious. With the Faketoshi patch, 0-conf ceases to be useful as even benign miners can be coopted into an attack.	el33th4xor	0	0	1528742252	1006244056165437450	https://twitter.com/el33th4xor/status/1006244056165437450			
	No, there's a difference between now and the world proposed by Faketoshi. Under all circumstances, 0-conf is risky for large amounts. Right now, 0-conf is insecure against a malicious miner. With the Faketoshi patch, it's plain old insecure at all times at all amounts.	el33th4xor	0	0	1528742162	1006243675519832064	https://twitter.com/el33th4xor/status/1006243675519832064			
	This stuff looks easy to the untrained, uneducated eye, but it's subtle. Conmen who plagiarize research from Chinese researchers aren't going to be able to come up with a coherent strategy.	el33th4xor	0	0	1528741066	1006239081825755137	https://twitter.com/el33th4xor/status/1006239081825755137			
	You think my tx is the only legitimate one, but then Faketoshi mines the 0-fee tx I sent. Faketoshi's brilliance just undermined the security of 0-conf, even with those two assumptions you mentioned.	el33th4xor	0	0	1528740849	1006238168805466117	https://twitter.com/el33th4xor/status/1006238168805466117			
	That's still broken. I send a self-payment, with 0-fees, to Faketoshi's 0-fee accepting miner. You don't see it because that tx is dropped in the network due to low fees, but Faketoshi accepts it. I pay you with a regular tx that looks good to you and obeys first-seen, for you.	el33th4xor	0	0	1528740771	1006237841490366464	https://twitter.com/el33th4xor/status/1006237841490366464			
	The problem presents itself for epsilon-fee tx's as well. It's not confined to 0-fee. In general, a network with different minimum tx-fees is a bad idea. Miners that accept 0-fee invite every node to set their own limit, which guarantees different limits, which impacts 0-conf.	el33th4xor	1	0	1528739326	1006231781585154048	https://twitter.com/el33th4xor/status/1006231781585154048			
	There's a subtlety here that some people miss, including Faketoshi. If we accept 0-fee tx's, and they are abused, and people kick out some 0-fee tx's, then I can pay with a 0-fee 0-conf, make you think I paid, but then do a double spend with a larger fee tx.	el33th4xor	0	0	1528739203	1006231264616177670	https://twitter.com/el33th4xor/status/1006231264616177670			
	Generally, no. In the few exceptional cases, the original people moved elsewhere and built a second system. Tech transfer is difficult without people physically carrying ideas with them.	el33th4xor	1	0	1528736822	1006221280167809024	https://twitter.com/el33th4xor/status/1006221280167809024			
	I see. Slush is really an intellectual stepping stone. It's not BFT, so it's not meant to be used in adversarial environments. You need the snowy protocols: Snowflake, Snowball, or Avalanche.	el33th4xor	1	0	1528736092	1006218216971042817	https://twitter.com/el33th4xor/status/1006218216971042817

	Just noticed the error in the title of that post. There's nothing in Avalanche that makes it specific to permissioned blockchains. In fact, the Ava coin we are building is permissionless.	el33th4xor	12	4	1528721384	1006156527454081029	https://twitter.com/el33th4xor/status/1006156527454081029			
	BTW, EOS seems to have some serious problems, related in spirit to the simple problem we saw with their ABP accounting, but I lack the time to clue them in. This captures how I feel:http://hackingdistributed.com/2018/05/30/choose-your-own-security-disclosure-adventure/ …	el33th4xor	2	0	1528719320	1006147869462712320	https://twitter.com/el33th4xor/status/1006147869462712320			
	Agreed. And I'm also perplexed that it took @ ercwl and I multiple iterations to get the vote suppression point to EOS fans. It's a simple liveness issue, and they seem completely blind to all liveness concerns.	el33th4xor	0	0	1528719207	1006147395791589382	https://twitter.com/el33th4xor/status/1006147395791589382			@

	Great to hear, and thank you for the answer on the conditions where ledger can be *used*.

	Indeed. But this process occurs out-of-protocol, and if hash power gets centralized, there is nothing one can do. Tweaking parameters, like making the blocks smaller, isn't going to change a thing. Even a PoW change will simply restart the whole process.	el33th4xor	1	0	1528704069	1006083903508090882	https://twitter.com/el33th4xor/status/1006083903508090882

	Unconscious bias is a fundamental of who we are. Complex beings cannot exist in a vacuum. Yes, lots of quantified studies, this is not new science. Conclusion: Those who recognise bias as such & shift to unbias decision making at significant advantage.https://www.hcamag.com/hr-news/how-three-corporate-giants-are-tackling-unconscious-bias-204756.aspx …	charliehalkett	0	1	1528701489	1006073083306872832	https://twitter.com/charliehalkett/status/1006073083306872832

	Since the launch of the beta and main net haven't happened yet their legal council (MME) told them to do the KYC check to make itself compliant with the current regulations.

	The KYC check now might seem odd since it's a year after the ICO, the fact is that most other ICOs were just handing out ERC20 tokens so they didn't need to build a working project yet before they could do the distribution.
