	The real fight, for greater adoption, is not within the crypto community. I continue to be an adamant advocate of reduced tension and civil behavior within the crypto space, and look forward to seeing Iota tackle its aggressive vision for combining blockchains with the IoT.	el33th4xor	116	7	1527628148	1001571163800301568	https://twitter.com/el33th4xor/status/1001571163800301568			
	The right thing to do, which I do imperfectly myself, is to assume good will on the part of other people. At least in cases where no prior ill will was demonstrated, this is provably the best strategy.	el33th4xor	64	4	1527628148	1001571162772656129	https://twitter.com/el33th4xor/status/1001571162772656129

	Subjective value judgments are indeed often wrong, and I'm not suggesting an appeal to authority. What does matter are objective proofs of safety and liveness. It would be too much to expect devs, even great ones, to produce these.	el33th4xor	0	0	1527626460	1001564085161529344	https://twitter.com/el33th4xor/status/1001564085161529344

	This is true: L2 is fundamentally in conflict with L1.

	# EOS friends, did you get any help from an expert on consensus protocols? You know not to roll your own crypto. Why are you rolling your own consensus protocol?

	Correct, but why? Is it merely naivety? Or is it growing distrust of the U.S. under Trump?
