bitcoin 	It’s not a Currency, it’s a token. I think they will all be traded against Bitcoin as the Currency.I think having every asset tradable against Bitcoin rather than USD or EUR or JPY is a very worthy goal and removes the world’s dependency on the US government. Tokens enable that.	SimonDixonTwitt	1	0	1524047931	986554647769788422	https://twitter.com/SimonDixonTwitt/status/986554647769788422

	Holy Grail is good-enough stability. Every currency board (other than Hong Kong's, a unique case) has failed. Just aspire to be as stable as a G8 currency.

	Also, why obsess with perfect pegs? Why not an algorithmic kind-of/mostly stable coin? Aim to simulate a (good) central bank, with randomness, imprecision and a touch of malice thrown in so speculators don't know which way you'll turn and can't risk betting big against you? 2/	mikejcasey	8	0	1524084664	986708713527443456	https://twitter.com/mikejcasey/status/986708713527443456			
	I try not to listen to everything @ prestonjbyrne says, but his takedown of the stablecoin concept was compelling. I'm convinced any algorithmic currency peg will be gamed, one way or another.

	And that, in itself, would have a mix of economic implications for the US, both good and bad, depending on one’s priorities and perspective: a trade-off.	prchovanec	0	0	1524073891	986663529494335488	https://twitter.com/prchovanec/status/986663529494335488			
	In my view, for instance, “weaponizing” the dollar against China would only hasten the day that people around the world turn to the Yuan as a more reliable medium of exchange and store of value.	prchovanec	1	0	1524073835	986663295422812160	https://twitter.com/prchovanec/status/986663295422812160			
	We talk about weaponizing the dollar, for instance. When that’s aimed at further isolating someone who’s already a pariah, the cost is fairly small. Therefore we may draw the wrong lessons, when we contemplate its wider application.	prchovanec	1	0	1524073657	986662546651394049	https://twitter.com/prchovanec/status/986662546651394049

	Second “tell” is throwing out the term “currency war” without specifying whether we’re talking about encouraging a stronger currency, a weaker currency, or what the potential trade-offs are for each.	prchovanec	0	0	1524072535	986657842504634369	https://twitter.com/prchovanec/status/986657842504634369

	One “tell” is when people talk about the future of the dollar or the future of the yuan without once mentioning what the balance of payments looks like, how it might change, and how that determines what is desirable or even possible.	prchovanec	0	0	1524072251	986656651443867648	https://twitter.com/prchovanec/status/986656651443867648

	What makes a reserve currency? Well, I can give you the economic and financial criteria I think it needs to meet.

	I’m not an economic determinist, by any means.
