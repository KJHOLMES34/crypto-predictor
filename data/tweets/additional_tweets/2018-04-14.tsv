bitcoin 	For the non-private pure-SoV use case, there’s a good argument that Bitcoin is done, should stay simple and decentralized. For the “Global Computing Platform” use case, further innovation is likely needed. So ongoing incentives for development matter.	naval	5	1	1523695975	985078434421399552	https://twitter.com/naval/status/985078434421399552			
	But in this Cambrian Coin Explosion, we will see coins that use inflation funding and centralized grants to fund engineering for a while, and then switch to decentralized models.	naval	6	1	1523695787	985077647238512641	https://twitter.com/naval/status/985077647238512641			
	But there seems to be no decentralized, on-chain solution to the problem. But the market will test BTC and ETH by creating “innovation incentives.” BTC has a weak implicit one (own some BTC). ETH has a slightly stronger one (ERC 20).	naval	5	1	1523695721	985077369340805120	https://twitter.com/naval/status/985077369340805120			
	What we have right now is suboptimal incentive allocation - all the rewards are going to founders, early investors and miners. None to late developers.

bitcoin 	So to sum up why I disagree: 1. People like choices, even if they don't understand them 2. People like getting paid more for less effort 3. Bitcoin changes require more effort than starting an altcoin or ICO 4. Even if innovations were compensated, people would start new coins	jimmysong	125	15	1523684078	985028533759209472	https://twitter.com/jimmysong/status/985028533759209472			
bitcoin 	"I grant you that there are some *trying* to innovate. Most I've seen are either bad or useless. ""Innovations"" that would get paid zero in Bitcoin are getting paid a lot in altcoin markets. Hence, I don't think altcoins would disappear with development rewards."	jimmysong	60	2	1523683171	985024732335656960	https://twitter.com/jimmysong/status/985024732335656960			
	That would be true if most coins' reasons for existence were innovations. I don't think that's true. Most coins have premines, dev taxes, foundations, etc. Maybe I'm cynical, but the reason most coins exist is to enrich the founders, not to innovate.	jimmysong	292	32	1523682882	985023518726377473	https://twitter.com/jimmysong/status/985023518726377473			
	That would be fair and worth exploring. That wouldn't prevent new coins from being created. The insane amount of money someone can make for filling out an ERC20 template is unreasonably high.	jimmysong	60	0	1523682357	985021316557352960	https://twitter.com/jimmysong/status/985021316557352960			
bitcoin 	They're worth more, but the amount of money you can make creating TRON vs creating a feature on Bitcoin is very different. The first is much better ROI and greed goes to better ROI.	jimmysong	17	2	1523682235	985020806785851392	https://twitter.com/jimmysong/status/985020806785851392			
bitcoin 	Unless the incentives were literally billions of dollars, I don't think this would work. Creating TRON got the creators way more than any reasonable reward a developer would have gotten for any feature in Bitcoin.	jimmysong	83	2	1523682142	985020416002527232	https://twitter.com/jimmysong/status/985020416002527232			
	Actually, maybe that's the point you're trying to make. Monetary incentives are what make devs work. I would say that such incentives wouldn't be big enough compared to altcoins or ICOs to satisfy the unadulterated greed that many people have.	jimmysong	8	0	1523682078	985020147588124672	https://twitter.com/jimmysong/status/985020147588124672			
	Disagree. If greed didn't exist, that would be true.	jimmysong	128	1	1523681892	985019366348591104	https://twitter.com/jimmysong/status/985019366348591104

	As far as I know, there are no gains for transferring between 2 wallets that you own. Only gains if it changes hands or gets traded for other crypto (depending on country).	CryptoHustle	3	0	1523722299	985188847536492544	https://twitter.com/CryptoHustle/status/985188847536492544			
	Yes, I agree it is a taxable event. So my point is to only use crypto that I'm not personally invested in as a currency and to only have that crypto interface with USD so that I don't incur tax. Was just trying to share some accounting insights, maybe I didn't explain it well.	CryptoHustle	6	0	1523720994	985183374510784513	https://twitter.com/CryptoHustle/status/985183374510784513			
	You completely missed my point. If I want to buy something with crypto I can buy LTC with USD and send that (no tax event). If I get paid in LTC n cash out to my bank (no tax event). Since I have no LTC investment I can use it as a currency. Nowhere did I mention BTC to LTC trade	CryptoHustle	7	0	1523720337	985180615283761152	https://twitter.com/CryptoHustle/status/985180615283761152			
	If I don't have LTC as an investment and someone pays me LTC so I can cash out to my bank, then I only get charged tax on the income and not on any additional investment gains.	CryptoHustle	5	0	1523719932	985178918360625152	https://twitter.com/CryptoHustle/status/985178918360625152

	This was all about trump looking powerful while making sure no one gets hurts and Russia isn't upset.

	Send a missile. Kill every one in charge. And that would save millions of lives. But IN THE WORLD WE LIVE IN. Russia is involved and that can't happen. So we bomb a dirt pile. No one is hurts.
