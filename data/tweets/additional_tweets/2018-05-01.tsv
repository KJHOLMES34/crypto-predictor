	You're a 15 year old :) Database sharding has been around for decades, and I did not even know that other toilet humor word until Twitter trolls brought it up.	VitalikButerin	497	22	1525201653	991393707957018624	https://twitter.com/VitalikButerin/status/991393707957018624

	Is inflation what's causing house prices to go up in real terms though (ie. increase more than other things)? Why would monetary inflation affect people's relative valuations of houses vs eg. food?

	There are other ways to sacrifice the future for the present. Debt in the context of a gold standard system certainly is one.	VitalikButerin	6	1	1525139313	991132235154669568	https://twitter.com/VitalikButerin/status/991132235154669568

	Even if debt were impossible without fiat (not true), that's maybe ~10-20% of gov expenditures. Not the sort of thing where militaries would shut down if it the option were to go away.	VitalikButerin	5	1	1525137817	991125957955104768	https://twitter.com/VitalikButerin/status/991125957955104768			
	The kinds of AML/KYC rules and credible threats of penalties that lead to banks rejecting crypto companies as clients, for example, have nothing to do with monetary policy.	VitalikButerin	3	2	1525137654	991125274858160128	https://twitter.com/VitalikButerin/status/991125274858160128

	And BTW not just buying houses, but also renting, is expensive. Rent prices can't go up directly due to financial bubbles in the same way that underlying asset prices can.	VitalikButerin	5	2	1525136881	991122032279486465	https://twitter.com/VitalikButerin/status/991122032279486465

	Not sure how to even answer that. Modern mainstream econ includes elements of Austrian, Keynes, Chicago, institutional economics, behavioral economics etc etc.....	VitalikButerin	25	1	1525136757	991121510982082562	https://twitter.com/VitalikButerin/status/991121510982082562			
	That's taxation, not inflation. Important difference. Taxation is usually considered *fiscal* policy, not monetary.	VitalikButerin	11	1	1525135941	991118091470819329	https://twitter.com/VitalikButerin/status/991118091470819329

	Mainstream econ :) There aren't really dueling schools anymore, it's more empirical and theory disagreements on the margin as well as lack of public understanding of what mainstrean econ even is or says.

	I read many econ books.They were crucial in helping me realize why Austrian econ is outdated and overly simplistic.	VitalikButerin	30	5	1525135187	991114927015321600	https://twitter.com/VitalikButerin/status/991114927015321600			
	You need to read more public choice theory literature IMO. There's a healthy skepticism of intellectuals and other nonprofit interests there that's a needed counterbalance/complement to skepticism about plutocracy.

	If there was a technique similar to public key cryptography that made people and cities resistant to all governments' missiles, I would absolutely promote it.	VitalikButerin	8	3	1525133770	991108985443962881	https://twitter.com/VitalikButerin/status/991108985443962881			
	Sure. But libertarians are not a large political constituency, so that would be a tougher battle.	VitalikButerin	5	0	1525133663	991108535906848768	https://twitter.com/VitalikButerin/status/991108535906848768			
	Control over financial layers probably in there, but that's not the same thing as monetary policy.	VitalikButerin	15	1	1525133576	991108172013223936	https://twitter.com/VitalikButerin/status/991108172013223936			
	Military and control over communication layers would definitely be up there.	VitalikButerin	20	1	1525133541	991108024088473600	https://twitter.com/VitalikButerin/status/991108024088473600

	Taxes. Which could happen just as easily under a gold standard. Crypto would make some types of taxes harder to collect, but we could just substitute with other taxes.	VitalikButerin	21	2	1525133156	991106408824291328	https://twitter.com/VitalikButerin/status/991106408824291328

	Do you think monetary policy is really the most important government power that needs checking? For me I'm not even sure it's in the top 5.	VitalikButerin	89	16	1525130554	991095496520318976	https://twitter.com/VitalikButerin/status/991095496520318976

	Our tax rate has gone down, a bit. Those who did v well were S-Corps w/ less than 400k income. Our ACA stayed flat by upgrading to Gold from Silver. The amount is almost exact same this year but premium and co-pay went down; part of loophole scam but it suited us . . .	stacyherbert	0	0	1525211456	991434823603376128	https://twitter.com/stacyherbert/status/991434823603376128

	Right they thought that it was unavoidably deterministic (only one signature possible per message with a given key). As that is not the case, user can set k=random in a loop rather than k=H(privateKey||message) and bypass PoS so it is really PoW.	adam3us	7	2	1525207675	991418964734500864	https://twitter.com/adam3us/status/991418964734500864			
	They misunderstand deterministic DSA as being unavoidably deterministically created (one possible signature per message with that key) as part of their PoS scheme. Given that is not the case it devolves their PoS scheme into a complex PoW scheme for people who understand this.	adam3us	2	0	1525189567	991343012843171840	https://twitter.com/adam3us/status/991343012843171840

	You can do that, but that really doesn't make much sense to do given that we have a concrete reality to deal with. If your advice, by not filling in details, make decisions ambiguous, your advice isn't really useful.	jimmysong	3	0	1525139254	991131984415125504	https://twitter.com/jimmysong/status/991131984415125504			
	You are telling other people that got in after these forks to invest in this way. You have to justify your advice.	jimmysong	2	0	1525138630	991129369316753408	https://twitter.com/jimmysong/status/991129369316753408

	"For some people it's not worth having any of these forks because the market share is so small relative to BTC. For others they want all of them even if it's 0.001% of the value of BTC. The ""risk"" you speak of is tiny and at some point, they're not worth paying attention to."	jimmysong	1	0	1525138543	991129002185252870	https://twitter.com/jimmysong/status/991129002185252870			
	At what point is a fork not worth owning? That's really at the heart of the whole discussion. If it's about features, then you have to know about every fork since any one of them might have better features. If it's something else, you have to give some criteria.	jimmysong	2	1	1525137940	991126473342963712	https://twitter.com/jimmysong/status/991126473342963712

	Where I fault Obama is other than mentioning it in passing he never pushed these issues with China and he did not invest politically/economically in Asia. Asia is filled with countries that would LOVE to be better friends with the US and he didn't do it.

	Agreed partially. If directly constraining/controlling Beijing is your metric, you're using the wrong metric & doomed to failure. Neither Trump or Obama can/should be measured like that.

	That would let Beijing know that weren't going to just steam roll and tell other countries they mattered to the US and the values we want to project? Absolutely not. Was not a priority in any way.
