litecoin 	It's either Namecoin or Ixcoin. I know at one point I also held some Solidcoins. This was mid 2011. Altcoins became a thing in 2011.

	I think it may take longer than 5 years. My guess is that in 20 years, the vast majority of people will be using cryptocurrencies in their daily lives. And some without even knowing that they are.

bitcoin litecoin 	I think of it as fungibility as oppose to anonymity. Fungibility is important for good money, and is one of the missing features from Bitcoin/Litecoin. It's definitely something that I want to add to Litecoin eventually. Something like Confidential Transaction. # BlockchainChat	SatoshiLite	42	13	1526600232	997259771655766016	https://twitter.com/SatoshiLite/status/997259771655766016		#	
	LN needs to be easy to use. Channel opening/closing/splitting needs to be automated and behind the scenes. And routing needs to be flushed out and seamless. Once we have those 2, users can just easily pay with LN without even realizing it's LN and not on-chain. # BlockchainChat	SatoshiLite	41	14	1526599923	997258474886123523	https://twitter.com/SatoshiLite/status/997258474886123523		#

	I think it's good. Cryptocurrency needs to be integrated with the current financial systems. So you can't not have the government involved. It's important for us to work with the regulators to make it easy for people to access cryptocurrencies.

	Ha, I get that. But you’re basically suggesting it’s ok to be legally non-compliant.

	One of my projects is http://gifbase.com  - a 6 year old website that gets maybe 5k visits a month. I haven’t touched the codebase in many years, so implementing cookie opt in + account delete + log rotation etc is major time/energy.

	I'm not saying those are things that web apps shouldn't implement.. but for a 3 year old side project with a few thousand visitors a month, that's a lot of dev work and energy you don't get paid for.	ummjackson	1	0	1526622150	997351702637375488	https://twitter.com/ummjackson/status/997351702637375488			
	How familiar are you with GDPR? You literally have to build systems for cookie consent, obfuscate/rotate logs that store IP addresses, a way for users to completely download their history and/or delete it permanently.

	Since firing off loosely veiled accusations is en vogue... I’m not convinced that Claire is capable of making such comments on her own, which is why she didn’t on the 15th. I suspect somebody was helping her last night, although I can’t imagine who or why. I’m blocking her now.	haydentiff	10	0	1526667623	997542430378463233	https://twitter.com/haydentiff/status/997542430378463233

	Exactly, it's a net money losing proposition to the operator, but a net win for the holders. It can only be funded collectively, individuals will not deploy ATMs on their own.	el33th4xor	1	0	1526648179	997460876214009857	https://twitter.com/el33th4xor/status/997460876214009857

bitcoin 	Bitcoin alone gives away $15M/day. That's 300+ ATMs, every single day. It's astounding that the entirety of that money goes to miners' pockets. A fraction of it could go to helping community development with ATMs deployed, or to promoting the cause of cryptocurrencies at large.https://twitter.com/btcfork/status/997388753797812224 …	el33th4xor	106	24	1526644116	997443835486769153	https://twitter.com/el33th4xor/status/997443835486769153			
	The value doesn't stem from burning equivalent cash, in the same way USD value does not stem from the government burning energy equivalent to a bill's denomination.	el33th4xor	1	0	1526642949	997438939584704512	https://twitter.com/el33th4xor/status/997438939584704512			
	It'll require a staking protocol, and a full currency requires a discussion of coin dynamics (minting, inflation control, etc). The paper is clear on this front, and there will be a follow-up paper on coin dynamics.pic.twitter.com/FWRaL1KUUR	el33th4xor	2	0	1526642767	997438175298678784	https://twitter.com/el33th4xor/status/997438175298678784			
	Indeed, this is exactly what I mentioned at Token Summit yesterday: one could use Avalanche for quick consensus, and the people who like the PoW mechanism could still use that for added security and minting.	el33th4xor	3	0	1526642196	997435782066528256	https://twitter.com/el33th4xor/status/997435782066528256

	No. The value proposition stems from properties of the system (decentralized, immutable, etc). Energy expenditure, incentivized through a demand-oblivious sequence of rewards to miners, is simply *how* the protocol achieves those properties.	el33th4xor	34	1	1526641659	997433530870390785	https://twitter.com/el33th4xor/status/997433530870390785

	No, all the standard Sybil mitigation techniques apply. Entering the network requires a resource, typically, a stake whose amount is determined by the network.	el33th4xor	1	0	1526641174	997431493147463680	https://twitter.com/el33th4xor/status/997431493147463680

	Because by the time you are openly supporting shooting a thousand people with precisely placed shots over days (i.e. it's not two kids who panicked with a 50cal) you've crossed the moral line. And you can't come back. See on what ground you are standing: justifying murder.	leashless	0	0	1526640899	997430343543263232	https://twitter.com/leashless/status/997430343543263232			
	No, no, really. The bottom line here is that not a single person had to die on that fence this month: there were fifty non lethal options, and murder was the chosen tool. At that point it's pretty clear that the old narrative about Gaza is dead. You'll need new propaganda now.	leashless	3	0	1526640805	997429948892708864	https://twitter.com/leashless/status/997429948892708864

	Sure. Hamas are, well, Hamas. But if they won the war, they'd be remembered like the French Resistance. Guerilla war is always brutal, on both sides. But on this occasion they came unarmed, and died in droves. They have their PR victory. The rest is going to get really ugly.	leashless	0	0	1526640570	997428960777695232	https://twitter.com/leashless/status/997428960777695232			
	"The Palestinians have finally got the PR victory they needed to shatter the Israeli line: it's over.

	It's not a conflict. In conflicts, both sides die. This is war crimes: soldiers massacring unarmed civilians. Insisting that a boy with a rock 300m away is an enemy soldier who can be rightfully killed is... Well, frankly, it's just how murderers always justify their actions.	leashless	1	0	1526640359	997428074810658816	https://twitter.com/leashless/status/997428074810658816			
	Only one side is dying. Therefore the other side is lying about it being war: it's shooting people who are unable to fight back. The relative death tolls are what tell the real story here, my friend.	leashless	4	0	1526639075	997422690469335040	https://twitter.com/leashless/status/997422690469335040

	No. You're a fucking asshole, a subhuman who easily confuses a bunch of helpless unarmed (or very, very lightly armed) people with an army which is shooting them, much like Jews being mown down in Ghettos seventy years ago.

	What most disturbs me about the coverage of the Palestinians being shot in the (mostly) legs https://www.thenation.com/article/palestinians-engaged-in-nonviolent-protest-israel-responded-with-a-massacre/ … is that when you talk about it, paid propagandists immediately pop up in your timeline pretending to be friends you have offended.
