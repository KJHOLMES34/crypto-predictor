bitcoin 	It has to do with how, when bitcoin transactions are first broadcast, they are unconfirmed. It takes six confirmations (inclusion in a block that becomes six blocks deep in the chain) before they are considered confirmed in the blockchain.	laurashin	0	0	2018-02-16 02:39:47	964313326380445696	https://twitter.com/laurashin/status/964313326380445696				0.15	-0.3569	0

ripple 	I believe a lot of people are testing ripple products.

ripple 	Yes. And I'll admit it's ambiguous and varies. The original conversation was - I doubt xrp is used as much as some PR would suggest. The ripple community seems angry about that statement. I also doubt the legal status of xrp as a bearer asset.

ripple 	I think you just summed up why I find the concept challenging from a financial services standpoint. That appears exactly like what they've done.

bitcoin 	Agreed. The question is the mechanism and therefore the definition of how it came into being. You can say that no person issued a freshly mined Bitcoin.

ripple 	Ripple as a network issues IOUs in return for fiat - much like PayPal would. Xrp is in effect issued by the dominant controller of the ripple network. Ripple labs inc.

ripple 	I've said before and I say again. For corporates wanting to avoid the banking system ripple is interesting. The concept of a natively digital asset is super interesting. But the creation and ownership structure of xrp isn't as simple as gold.	sytaylor	1	0	2018-02-16 16:47:28	964526650485563393	https://twitter.com/sytaylor/status/964526650485563393				0.22	0.3114	0
ripple 	That works great if I hold a ton of xrp. Which requires the asset becoming much more legitimate. But it's setup and ripple labs dominance scares off mainstream banks. Large corporations I can see it for. But I don't see a direct parallel with gold if it were gifted by founders	sytaylor	1	0	2018-02-16 16:45:34	964526174817923072	https://twitter.com/sytaylor/status/964526174817923072				0.20	0.1666	0
ripple 	No it is an IOU. That's exactly what it is. Unless ripple are a central bank. I exchange fiat for xrp and the only entity that settles xrp is ripple.	sytaylor	1	0	2018-02-16 16:40:17	964524842438414337	https://twitter.com/sytaylor/status/964524842438414337				0.27	0.015	0
