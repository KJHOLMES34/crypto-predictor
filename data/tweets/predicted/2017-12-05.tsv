bitcoin 	because Bitcoin benefits from network effects, where more use cases increase value, other than direct internal priorities and relative cost, there can be an argument for going the extra mile because that is win-win, and so helps users and each company also.	adam3us	1	0	1512490191	938077972463984641	https://twitter.com/adam3us/status/938077972463984641				-0.05	0.8141	0
bitcoin 	i think the point being made is it pushes fees higher & scale lower - for those not yet upgraded, and everyone else. not upgrading because the cost not priority for your use case is a form of negative economic externality: holds back Bitcoin generally and limits other use cases.	adam3us	1	0	1512490079	938077499631665152	https://twitter.com/adam3us/status/938077499631665152				0.22	-0.4339	0
