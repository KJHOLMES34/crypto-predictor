bitcoin 	Bitcoin mining is a competitive, commodity business. As a result, it's difficult for any one company to retain the lead. The hatred directed at (certain, selected) miners is politically motivated, the result of clueless devs who love to divide the community. https:// twitter.com/RT_com/status/ 959001643164585984 …	el33th4xor	60	9	2018-02-01 13:03:05	959034364318371840	https://twitter.com/el33th4xor/status/959034364318371840				0.38	-0.0138	0

	At the same time, making Tether a cryptocoin allows it to be traded between exchanges, which helps prop up its value. So there is a financial benefit to the transparency, but are the costs (of being questioned daily on social media, and now the press) worth it?	el33th4xor	15	1	2018-02-01 02:28:12	958874592583602177	https://twitter.com/el33th4xor/status/958874592583602177				0.09	0.5121	0
