bitcoin 	> Unlike fiat though, LN's settlement to Bitcoin is cryptographically secured and cannot be removed!

	I should rephrase. In the last 3 years, the crypto market cap has increased by 200x, but I definitely don't feel like crypto's *potential* has increased by 200x.

	Yes, agree. I guess I am reacting to the fact that not only is there not $0.5T of actual (monetizable) impact, but I currently don't even see *the necessary precursors* for it.
