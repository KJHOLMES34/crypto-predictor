bitcoin 	If GHash.io had successfully 51% attacked bitcoin, its price would NOT have dropped to zero. It would have dropped maybe 90% and the core devs would have stayed up a few nights and made an emergency switch to PoS, at which point the price would have partially recovered.

	So accepting a 1% issuance rate to avoid a 1% chance of attack per year is actually really not that smart a choice to make, at least if your use of a blockchain is for a cryptocurrency to store your value.

bitcoin 	And yes, in either PoW or PoS, this WILL happen. The idea that if a 51% spawn camp attack happens, all $190b of bitcoin's users will just pack up their bags and leave is absurd; way too much incentive to coordinate and try to continue the ledger.

	I agree with all of that and am myself a supporter of crypto.

bitcoin 	This paper appears to be about sniffing DNS traffic, but Bitcoin nodes don't use DNS in day to day operation - they generally only make DNS requests during their very first boot to grab IP addresses from the seed nodes.	lopp	18	1	2018-01-22 19:53:21	955513732758753280	https://twitter.com/lopp/status/955513732758753280				0.23	0.0	0

bitcoin 	9/ It's actually somewhat miraculous that bitcoin has gotten to where it has -- and this is meaningful. I wouldn't bet against it just yet.	AriannaSimpson	228	13	2018-01-22 13:12:27	955412843175825408	https://twitter.com/AriannaSimpson/status/955412843175825408				0.48	0.1591	0
bitcoin 	6/ This will sound crazy to most, but I don't think the likelihood that bitcoin goes to zero is much higher than that most public stocks are wiped out. In 2013, that risk was much greater for bitcoin. But as the number of hodlers increases, network effects become stronger.
