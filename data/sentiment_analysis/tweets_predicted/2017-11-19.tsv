bitcoin 	No, there isn't, it's the same thing. Why does it matter if the asset backing an anonymous token is $ GOLD or $ USD? # Tether is Centralized # Bitcoin. What would happen to the money backing $ BTC if it just sat there in X number of bank accounts? Would it not ceased by now?

bitcoin 	I made it very clear in yesterdays # Bitcoin Group on @ WorldCryptoNet that it don't if every $ USDT is actually backed $ USD. It's a huge systemic risk cause it's not different than # Egold or Liberty Reserve.https://youtu.be/ntxiXqXiYbA?t=30m50s …	ToneVays	10	0	1511061578	932085931741466626	https://twitter.com/ToneVays/status/932085931741466626		# #	@	1	0.34	1	0.9770881318935906	1.0
