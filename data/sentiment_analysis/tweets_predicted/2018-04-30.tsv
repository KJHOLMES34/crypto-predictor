ethereum 	One wins and the other loses. At least Ethereum's brand of sharding doesn't really change the single-chain status quo.	VitalikButerin	9	2	1525116825	991037913151430657	https://twitter.com/VitalikButerin/status/991037913151430657				0	0.17	1	0.9839654042259379	-1.0
ethereum 	In Ethereum sharding, there's no notion of shards being mapped to specific long-term node clusters or geographies etc; it's not like there's a Shanghai shard, Toronto shard, etc. All shards take their (frequently reshuffled) validator sets from globally dispersed nodes.
