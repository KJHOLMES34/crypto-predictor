ripple 	It might be a little surprising because I don’t think anybody was expecting this so soon, but a diverse group of participants has ALWAYS been part of the plan! I think this is why RippleNet exists.

ripple 	When Ripple is the only one building on the network, it’s hard to separate support for the network and XRP from the company.
