bitcoin 	It’s not a ‘51% attack,’ it’s a Soros attack. He can corner the # Bitcoin market - as trade war destroys fiat currencies all over the world - and get the same bang! as cornering the Gold market, but for .0125 the cost.	maxkeiser	168	76	1523058880	982406266285903872	https://twitter.com/maxkeiser/status/982406266285903872		#		1	0.44	-1	0.9800853485064012	1.0
bitcoin 	Think about it, Soros could buy half of the entire # Bitcoin supply and have a gain of approx. $300 billion - as we approach the next halving. He doesn’t have to sell - the halving cuts supply in half for him. A speculator’s dream.
