bitcoin 	All banks everywhere will get hit like this. Central Banks are printing trillions more fiat - and failing - to paper over the cracks.

ripple 	So, keep in mind that I’m an outsider and this is just my perspective. Banks, along with every type of payment provider, are encouraged to join RippleNet for access to liquidity. Banks don’t have to know if XRP was used by a market maker. Some banks will become market makers.	haydentiff	2	0	1528564646	1005499119845167106	https://twitter.com/haydentiff/status/1005499119845167106				-1	0.14	1	0.98964906	-1.0

ripple 	My point is mostly that anyone can create a coin, but not everyone can create value. People think Ripple just “printed” those XRP, unfairly creating money. It’s not unfair if everyone has this option. I created 10 trillion $ FORK tokens after reading a blog.
