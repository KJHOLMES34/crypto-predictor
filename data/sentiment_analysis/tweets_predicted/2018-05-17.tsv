bitcoin 	Those platforms all offer a tangible service that is being used by millions of real world users, unlike Bitcoin. Furthermore, they have since become more energy efficient through centralization. Decentralized PoW can't do that.	ummjackson	0	0	1526594309	997234930756157440	https://twitter.com/ummjackson/status/997234930756157440				1	0.22	1	0.9769417475728155	1.0

bitcoin 	The person you debated held his own. Saying everything outside # bitcoin is a 'timeshare' is lazy. There will be 10-20 winners here & you will lose the bet w/ him. You should not take a shot at the entire industry. There are legitimate projects although they are few & far between.

bitcoin 	Bitcoin incentivizes miners to seek out the cheapest sources of electricity. The cheapest sources are actually renewable; the incentives are aligned just fine. The claim that Bitcoin mining will destroy the environment is unfounded.pic.twitter.com/YvRFfPRAlO	lopp	17	1	1526561273	997096364398936064	https://twitter.com/lopp/status/997096364398936064				1	0.02	-1	0.9769417475728155	1.0
