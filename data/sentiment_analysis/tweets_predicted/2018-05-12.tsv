bitcoin 	Well it affects their cash reserves and short term profitability. For people with reserves or revenue and an interest to accumulate as many Bitcoin as possible, a low price is preferable as it deters other cash return seeming and lower cash reserve miners.	adam3us	3	1	1526148817	995366400158941184	https://twitter.com/adam3us/status/995366400158941184				1	0.21	1	0.9735841174546407	1.0
bitcoin 	some mine to accumulate bitcoin, some are philosophical (see value in decentralised hashrate so put part of their holdings into mining to support decentralisation value), others skip in and out and aim to make USD profit, others will buy BTC or buy miners depending on conditions.	adam3us	6	3	1526128501	995281188540608512	https://twitter.com/adam3us/status/995281188540608512				1	0.79	1	0.9735841174546407	1.0
bitcoin 	one second order effect: miners are making big investments in bitcoin's future, say hypothetically that they are good at predicting price and adoption; then watching their financial bets via hashrate increases maybe tells you what they are thinking about the future of bitcoin.	adam3us	4	0	1526128404	995280781466636288	https://twitter.com/adam3us/status/995280781466636288				1	0.44	1	0.9735841174546407	1.0
bitcoin 	it's just an electricity dollar cost estimate (electrical break even) for mining a bitcoin vs price ratio P/BE. presumably averaged over the efficiency of miners deployed and electricity costs. it's technical analysis not fundamental analysis other than 2nd order effects.	adam3us	6	0	1526125321	995267850091843584	https://twitter.com/adam3us/status/995267850091843584				1	0.12	1	0.9735841174546407	1.0
