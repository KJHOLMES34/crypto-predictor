bitcoin ripple 	Well, a lot of the infrastructure that Ripple/ILP are providing can be used for Bitcoin as well. XRP will have to compete with every other digital asset.

bitcoin 	that means nothing... they are a company... it's like the escrow you use for a home down payment. There is nothing technological that forces that money to stay in escrow, this tech only exists in Bitcoin... and maybe Ether but in Ether someone will steal it (ex: TheDAO)	ToneVays	3	0	1528471426	1005108128239759360	https://twitter.com/ToneVays/status/1005108128239759360				1	0.14	-1	0.99215263	-1.0

ripple 	yes, it could, if the head of the FED shows up at @ Ripple's office and demands the keys to the 66 Billion $ XRP tokens sitting at # Ripple they will hand them over.... do you NOT understand the word # Decentralization?

ripple 	U can't have an informed conversation, it's like talking to Fake Satoshi... his entire life depends on the success of # Ripple and it does not matter that the token itself is scammy, not needed & obviously centralized.
