bitcoin 	It's a very valid question, but in the end the $ BTC value is the only thing that matters. You eventually have to move from that alt to Bitcoin. Every exchange is denominated in Bitcoin.

bitcoin 	Using USD is fine - just make sure that USD gain is more than $ BTC gained in USD over the holding period.
