bitcoin 	I have to ask one last question: I just put out a tweet storm meant to be in good spirits and asking everyone just to be respectful. Why is one of the first replies from a Core Developer who instantly uses a term that Bitcoin Cash supporters find derogatory?

bitcoin 	Both are children of the genesis block and Bitcoin Cash has sufficient liquidity and market cap that it cannot be ignored.

bitcoin 	Bottom line, let’s just move on and stop fighting. Focus on whichever philosophy you feel most strongly aligned too. Bitcoin Cash should use the green logo and Bitcoin should keep the orange logo. Hard to confuse them and I think it’s becoming very clear which is which.

bitcoin 	If you’re long on Bitcoin itself as a technology, you should own both in a ratio of 1 BTC : 1 BCH to avoid risk of either side winning/losing, if you favor BCH, hold maybe 2-3+ BCH for every BTC you own, if you favor BTC religiously, then dump your BCH but remember you bear risk.

bitcoin 	You are confusing financial instructions with the Currency. GBP is not regulated, the rules on its issuance are set by central banks. Bitcoin is not regulated, the rules on its issuance are set by maths, Code and consensus. Nothing ridiculous there just not what you are used to.
