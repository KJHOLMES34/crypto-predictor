ripple 	Yes. And I'll admit it's ambiguous and varies. The original conversation was - I doubt xrp is used as much as some PR would suggest. The ripple community seems angry about that statement.

ripple 	I think you just summed up why I find the concept challenging from a financial services standpoint. That appears exactly like what they've done.

ripple 	Which works IF you believe ripple is a complaint issuer of an asset. Which I think is a challenging position to take Therefore it's not functioning as bearer	sytaylor	0	0	1518796382	964528053656440832	https://twitter.com/sytaylor/status/964528053656440832				-1	0.12	1	0.9196307362783962	1.0

ripple 	Ripple as a network issues IOUs in return for fiat - much like PayPal would. Xrp is in effect issued by the dominant controller of the ripple network. Ripple labs inc. It's acting like a central bank and that raises real governance questions - that's not a red herring at all	sytaylor	0	0	1518796211	964527333498605568	https://twitter.com/sytaylor/status/964527333498605568				1	0.18	1	0.9196307362783962	1.0
ripple 	I've said before and I say again. For corporates wanting to avoid the banking system ripple is interesting. The concept of a natively digital asset is super interesting. But the creation and ownership structure of xrp isn't as simple as gold.	sytaylor	1	0	1518796048	964526650485563393	https://twitter.com/sytaylor/status/964526650485563393				-1	0.31	1	0.9196307362783962	1.0
ripple 	That works great if I hold a ton of xrp. Which requires the asset becoming much more legitimate. But it's setup and ripple labs dominance scares off mainstream banks. Large corporations I can see it for. But I don't see a direct parallel with gold if it were gifted by founders	sytaylor	1	0	1518795934	964526174817923072	https://twitter.com/sytaylor/status/964526174817923072				1	0.17	1	0.9196307362783962	1.0
ripple 	No it is an IOU. That's exactly what it is. Unless ripple are a central bank. I exchange fiat for xrp and the only entity that settles xrp is ripple.	sytaylor	1	0	1518795617	964524842438414337	https://twitter.com/sytaylor/status/964524842438414337				1	0.02	1	0.9196307362783962	1.0
ripple 	"""nobody"" was not used as an absolute term. For the 100+ companies working with ripple you can cite 6 using xrp in pilot mode.

ripple 	Bearer assets have an issuer. Physical notes are a bearer instruments, the issuer is a central bank. Ripple is in effect playing the role of an asset issuer. Bearer assets are subject to settlement and credit risks, which *are* counterparty risks.	sytaylor	2	0	1518780785	964462633486311424	https://twitter.com/sytaylor/status/964462633486311424				1	0.18	1	0.9196307362783962	1.0
