bitcoin ripple 	1/ No coin is fully decentralized yet, but some, like bitcoin are “on the path to decentralization.” I was very bullish on EOS because I respect Dan Larimer and the team, however this is shameful. I am putting EOS in the same category as Ripple.https://twitter.com/whalepool/status/1008598454317305856 …	CharlieShrem	798	255	1529334011	1008726073079685120	https://twitter.com/CharlieShrem/status/1008726073079685120				1	0.12	1	0.9806788	1.0
bitcoin 	While I do trade shitcoins and tokens to make more Bitcoin, I think it would be unethical of me to not point out the scams and major issues with $ crypto projects. Maybe before you call me a fudder, it might be good to check if you're not just a disgruntled bagholder. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯	WhalePanda	132	13	1529343811	1008767177556742145	https://twitter.com/WhalePanda/status/1008767177556742145				1	0.12	-1	0.9377412	-1.0
bitcoin 	They often pump harder because of their centralization (marketing, supply controlled by a few people,...) but I will never shill anything like that and will always point out their flaws. Bitcoin had plenty of issues but it tends to get rid of them (Hearn, Garzik, Ver, Andresen)	WhalePanda	65	6	1529343729	1008766834387103745	https://twitter.com/WhalePanda/status/1008766834387103745				1	0.20	-1	0.9784848	-1.0
ripple 	"I've been a trader long enough to know that fundamentally flawed projects (ETH, EOS,...), centralized scams (Ripple, BCash,...) and other projects that make no sense (""Privacy"" coin with optional privacy, with a company in US wtf?) can pump hard, so of course I trade them."
