bitcoin 	Good question, though I don't think it's a simple answer because it would depend upon the amount of traffic your node is routing, which depends upon several variables. A LN node that doesn't route much would be less resource intensive than a bitcoin node.	lopp	2	0	1529439115	1009166909911289861	https://twitter.com/lopp/status/1009166909911289861				1	0.22	1	0.9714796	-1.0
ethereum 	The community did no such thing for the Ethereum hard fork, it was decided by a dozen or so people. Further, EOS is doing the same thing. Dont kid yourself.

ethereum 	Maybe. I sometimes wonder where Ethereum would be if they hadn’t forked. Imagine what kind of long-term message that would have shown. “No one has the power to freeze or control a tx, not even when hundreds of millions are lost.” Alas, with EOS, we will never know.
