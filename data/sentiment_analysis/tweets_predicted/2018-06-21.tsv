litecoin 	Not sure how anyone can know. Is it possible? Sure. Current trajectory of BTC price growth gets us there, but who knows. As for LTC, it won't be 1/4 of BTC value unless Litecoin becomes the number 1 coin. That's not likely. 1/20 is a more reasonable target.

bitcoin 	34/ TL;DR Governments use monetary intervention as a swiss army knife for society’s problems. This undermines the function of money and has unintended consequences. Politically neutral protocols like Bitcoin could be superior because they are reliable, robust, and modular.	TuurDemeester	50	15	1529596259	1009826019069620224	https://twitter.com/TuurDemeester/status/1009826019069620224				1	0.02	1	0.9899629	-1.0
bitcoin 	33/ And so I see Bitcoin as a small but performant monetary building block that can serve to diminish interpersonal conflict in society. Much technology and many institutions will need to be built around it, no doubt. But it’s an exhilarating start.	TuurDemeester	22	4	1529596259	1009826018117419009	https://twitter.com/TuurDemeester/status/1009826018117419009				1	0.32	-1	0.97444713	1.0
bitcoin 	30/ Of course, Bitcoin in itself isn’t going to solve all the interpersonal problems that governments are trying to solve. But it holds the promise of doing one thing extremely well: be a reliable form of money.	TuurDemeester	24	5	1529596258	1009826014594322432	https://twitter.com/TuurDemeester/status/1009826014594322432				1	0.27	1	0.9785355	1.0
bitcoin 	29/ Bitcoin diminishes conflicts by means of technology, much like how car locks diminish car thefts. It’s a protocol that allows users to peacefully enforce their right to control their own financial future.	TuurDemeester	29	10	1529596257	1009826013428281346	https://twitter.com/TuurDemeester/status/1009826013428281346				1	0.25	1	0.98127365	-1.0
bitcoin 	28/ And so, paradoxically, by efficiently removing free access to a scarce monetary good, Bitcoin becomes a socially scalable technological enforcer of property rights.	TuurDemeester	25	3	1529596257	1009826011654098944	https://twitter.com/TuurDemeester/status/1009826011654098944				1	0.85	1	0.96880215	-1.0
bitcoin 	27/ This triple combo allows for bitcoin to be highly divisible, highly portable and scalable, highly durable (predictable supply curve), and therefore it holds the promise of a universally desirable store of value and medium of exchange.	TuurDemeester	22	4	1529596257	1009826010609672192	https://twitter.com/TuurDemeester/status/1009826010609672192				1	0.72	1	0.996403	-1.0
bitcoin 	26/ On the contrary, Bitcoin is an incredibly powerful startup currency _because_ it fully enables plurality, scarcity, and diversity.	TuurDemeester	15	2	1529596257	1009826009728933888	https://twitter.com/TuurDemeester/status/1009826009728933888				1	0.48	1	0.9873854	-1.0
bitcoin 	25/ But Bitcoin doesn’t touch at all on the three other categories of conflict-causes. Isn’t that a setback?	TuurDemeester	16	2	1529596084	1009825286568009734	https://twitter.com/TuurDemeester/status/1009825286568009734				1	0	0	0.98550713	-1.0
bitcoin 	24/ This core ability to restrict free access is not dependent on the decision of a political committee, but rather innate, hardwired in the technology. To borrow from Nick Szabo, Bitcoin is a socially scalable, conflict preventing protocol.	TuurDemeester	31	3	1529596084	1009825285653651456	https://twitter.com/TuurDemeester/status/1009825285653651456				1	0.05	-1	0.99905235	-1.0
bitcoin 	23/ However, there is one cause of conflict that Bitcoin does _not_ allow for: free access. Nobody can mint bitcoins in excess of the 21M supply, and with sufficient precautions taken, existing coins can be protected against access from anyone anywhere.	TuurDemeester	23	3	1529596084	1009825284558909442	https://twitter.com/TuurDemeester/status/1009825284558909442				1	0.44	1	0.9973768	-1.0
bitcoin 	22/ Bitcoin 100% allows for plurality and diversity: anyone can use it, and the network is censorship resistant - opening the door for any and all diversity. It is also decidedly a scarce good.	TuurDemeester	23	2	1529596083	1009825283615154176	https://twitter.com/TuurDemeester/status/1009825283615154176				1	0.25	1	0.9837006	1.0
bitcoin 	20/ Now, let’s switch to Bitcoin. In what ways could Bitcoin contribute to diminishing interpersonal conflict?	TuurDemeester	17	3	1529596083	1009825281673179137	https://twitter.com/TuurDemeester/status/1009825281673179137				1	0.16	-1	0.9836	-1.0
bitcoin 	1/ In this thread I make a philosophical argument for Bitcoin being a socially scalable contribution to conflict prevention in society, contrasting it with the current system of monetary interventionism.

bitcoin 	Volatility in Bitcoin from temporary uncertainty about its future (vs. both political opposition & crypto competitors), not from its supply limit.

bitcoin 	The value of Bitcoin as SoV, MoWT, and in future via layer2 MoCE is indeed based on its strong & seamlessly global security vs. double-spending, censorship, etc. & prospects for better key management, not on merely economic measures like price and volatility (which will adapt).https://twitter.com/BIGbenStew/status/1009868186890752001 …	NickSzabo4	260	81	1529606876	1009870550741671936	https://twitter.com/NickSzabo4/status/1009870550741671936				1	0.52	1	0.9725654	1.0
