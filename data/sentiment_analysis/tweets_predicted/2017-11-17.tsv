bitcoin 	It wasn't all that hard to get consensus to do a safe blocksize increase via segwit among the competent side of the 2X debate. That's because the real disagreement is about centralization. For instance, whether a tiny group meeting in a NY hotel should control Bitcoin's future.	peterktodd	158	28	1510935041	931555197997977602	https://twitter.com/peterktodd/status/931555197997977602				1	0.14	1	0.9893835411415701	1.0
bitcoin 	With Core-vs-2X, the story isn't two differing opinions on the right way to scale Bitcoin; the real story is one side trying to build a decentralized currency, and another side w/ various motivations to make Bitcoin more centralized (who happened to have some incompetent devs).	peterktodd	239	51	1510934643	931553527436120064	https://twitter.com/peterktodd/status/931553527436120064				1	0.48	-1	0.9893835411415701	1.0
bitcoin 	Within the competent side of Bitcoin, there's actually a lot of disagreement; I personally think much of the long-term direction and focus of Bitcoin Core is misguided. But those disagreements are minor compared to how batshit crazy the 2X/BCH/Craig Wright side is.	peterktodd	253	52	1510934046	931551026812997633	https://twitter.com/peterktodd/status/931551026812997633				1	0.34	-1	0.9893835411415701	1.0

bitcoin 	that is correct as well, which is why if Satoshi decided to dump his coins, he can crash the MCap of # Bitcoin by 90% cause he is holding 5%. If 90% of # Bitcoin MCap was actively traded him dumping 5% will not make that much of a problem.

bitcoin 	It's not from Tether, but you cannot compare tether MCap to Bitcoin MCap, you have to compare it Bitcoin actively traded.	ToneVays	0	0	1510888968	931361953842315265	https://twitter.com/ToneVays/status/931361953842315265				1	0.45	1	0.9893835411415701	1.0
bitcoin 	NO, I meant it CAN have a 90% affect on price because I cannot see more than 10% of all bitcoin in the market cap actively traded. I don't think you get it.

bitcoin 	not it can move it like 90%, cause maybe 10% of that market is tradable the rest is in cold storage by people or is lost. you have to compare tether liquidity to amount of bitcoin circulating on exchanges not total MCap.
