bitcoin 	Yes, if the algorithm is simple and has no exploit. It's hard to beat Bitcoin's diff change algo in simplicity. And complicated ago leads to potential bugs. Very likely that miners can exploit BCH's new DAA to make more money.	SatoshiLite	2	0	1510496134	929714288226320385	https://twitter.com/SatoshiLite/status/929714288226320385				1	0.04	-1	0.9010499474305185	1.0
litecoin 	Forgot to mention. BCH is a lot more miner centralized. Because its network hashrate is a lot less than BTC, a small BTC pool can 51% attack it. So it's security is weak because of that. Litecoin doesn't have this problem because Litecoin dominates Scrypt hashing.	SatoshiLite	1383	362	1510485481	929669607236845568	https://twitter.com/SatoshiLite/status/929669607236845568				1	0.20	-1	0.9010499474305185	1.0
bitcoin 	BCH also uses the same address space. So much confusion. This hurts everyone. Given all that, the only possible outcome is that one coin will go to $0 in the long term. My bet is obviously on Bitcoin. All the short term price movement doesn't really matter. I'm not trading it.	SatoshiLite	665	154	1510485179	929668342079557632	https://twitter.com/SatoshiLite/status/929668342079557632				1	0.13	-1	0.9010499474305185	1.0
bitcoin 	BCH also has brand confusion. That's why people refer to it as Bcash. That's honestly a better name than Bitcoin Cash, which is a mouthful. But BCH supporters would never accept not being called Bitcoin. Because they believe it's the real Bitcoin.	SatoshiLite	558	92	1510485032	929667724598329344	https://twitter.com/SatoshiLite/status/929667724598329344				1	0.12	1	0.9010499474305185	1.0
bitcoin 	Without decentralization, you lose censorship resistance. Censorship resistance is what gives Bitcoin value. Without that, it's just PayPal 2.0, which is not revolutionary. BCH also has a very weak dev team when compared to Bitcoin Core. It's like high school team against pros.	SatoshiLite	1326	439	1510484800	929666753226874881	https://twitter.com/SatoshiLite/status/929666753226874881				1	0.04	-1	0.9010499474305185	1.0
bitcoin 	To be honest, BCH can compete well against LTC to be Bitcoin's silver. But their arrogance wouldn't let settle for second. Their current strategy is winner take all against Bitcoin, and they will lose because of these reasons: Perpetual onchain scaling destroys decentralization	SatoshiLite	1000	287	1510484691	929666294806331393	https://twitter.com/SatoshiLite/status/929666294806331393				1	0.08	-1	0.9010499474305185	1.0

bitcoin 	I remember. But you can't fight something by denying it. There is a flaw in Bitcoin. That flaw is mining. Satoshi is (was) a great mathematician, but had no understanding of business. Business is war. Pure and simple. And in war, there is always a winner.	officialmcafee	296	82	1510514176	929789964052828165	https://twitter.com/officialmcafee/status/929789964052828165				1	0.09	-1	0.9010499474305185	1.0
bitcoin 	And what is wrong with Asicboost? It is a competitive innovation. Mining is competitive. It was designed to be so. It is a business. Businesses always centralize. Why do you care?

bitcoin 	Yes. All things do. But in the long term what will replace It? There is no replacement for a longer block chain. Segwit is a tool that punishes Jihan and accomplishes nothing. Bitcoin as it is cannot stand due to block size limitations. What is left?

bitcoin 	I'm not sure how substantive that list is. I see little understanding here. Bitcoin cannot survive without an immediate increase in block size. Everyone knows this.
