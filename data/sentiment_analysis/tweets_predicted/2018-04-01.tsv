bitcoin 	That’s crap, because we used to sell tens of millions of dollars in Bitcoin every year for gift cards at retailers @ gyft - how long have you been in crypto for? Bitpay used to process billions for Bitcoin too for businesses.

bitcoin 	The Bitcoin scaling problem was effectively solved by forcing merchants to accept other coins for payments, as Bitcoin was changed from a “Medium of Exchange” to a “Store of Value”. I disagreed with this strategy but still interested to see how it plays out.https://twitter.com/josephkunzler/status/979955599541788673 …	VinnyLingham	168	41	1522542227	980239263437475840	https://twitter.com/VinnyLingham/status/980239263437475840				1	0.42	1	0.9665848868344079	1.0

bitcoin 	I don’t agree with this at all. First, Bitcoin users are not citizens, they are private individuals utilizing software they find helpful.
