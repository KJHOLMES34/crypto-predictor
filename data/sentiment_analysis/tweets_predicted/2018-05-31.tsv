bitcoin 	It would hurt confidence. But as you can see from Verge and Bitcoin Gold, it doesn't hurt that much. If the attacker does a sustained attack where they orphan other miners and mine empty blocks, that could really annihilate a coin. It would scare off all other miners.

litecoin 	Here's a quick analysis to show that DigiByte's 5-algo system isn't more secure than Litecoin. To match the whole DigiByte network, it costs about $27MM and $1k/hr to attack. But since global hashrate for each algo dominates DigiByte's, it can likely all be rented for <$5000/hr.pic.twitter.com/tRsaVlNTt7	SatoshiLite	355	94	1527745448	1002063157681012736	https://twitter.com/SatoshiLite/status/1002063157681012736				0	0.24	-1	0.9946879150264476	1.0
litecoin 	Sure, but why would an ongoing Twitter poll make it shady for me to reach out to chat with their CEO about a potential partnership?

litecoin 	Surprise! We don't bribe companies to support Litecoin. They do it because it's good for business. TapJets tried to contact XRP folks before I reached out. It's not my problem.
