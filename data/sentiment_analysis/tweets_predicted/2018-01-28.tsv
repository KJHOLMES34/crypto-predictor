bitcoin 	I’m still in. I see huge utility. I’m also grateful to see the other experiments to see what really works and does not work in live environment. The old #Bitcoin is a Ponzi argument died in 2013 and is only continued by old bankers and gold bugs. If $ BTC is Ponzi so are others.

bitcoin 	While people talk about #Bitcoin losing market share, this does not give the full picture. Thousands of #Altcoins launch & both have grown together making the market bigger.
