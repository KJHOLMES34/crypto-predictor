	Interesting thanks! Non-coin gold wasn't then widely circulated outside upper & merchant classes much of anywhere, AFAIK, and even in coin form smallest denomination too big for most. Wage stated per month but how often actually paid? Likely much more frequent than monthly.	NickSzabo4	3	0	1522975780	982057717798809601	https://twitter.com/NickSzabo4/status/982057717798809601			
	Speculative. Rejection of gold & silver could easily have had many other causes, e.g. (1) most clans didn't provide enough value from trade or relationships for higher-value silver much less gold to work better as payment, (2) networks effects (lock-in) of these other forms.

	The issue is not win rate or % profitable months. The issue IS how much you make during winning months and how little you lose during losing months. 15% of my trades produce 85% of my profits.

	There is a time to make money in the markets and a time to keep it. Recognizing where you are in this cycle is crucial to long-term profitability.

	4. Perhaps the recent slew of deaths in VC on-demand companies should serve as a reminder that growth is a death sentence when it's not built on solid foundations.

	3. These ICOs should have been capped. There is no world in which a pre-product company needs more than 20M.

	This is a very important point, and a good thread. There are some, like Kudlow, who - right or wrong - see this as leverage to help open trade. There are others, like Navarro (and maybe Trump?) who see trade as a win-lose game that the US loses from and is better off without.https://twitter.com/AlexHSullivan/status/982259844282368000 …	prchovanec	15	9	1523024141	982260560552083457	https://twitter.com/prchovanec/status/982260560552083457

	Since 1971, the dollar is a reserve currency of choice. The other options are only less attractive so long as we keep it so.
