	> on average wealthy give away a smaller fraction of income than poor!

	Agree this is worth exploring; @ glenweyl's recent book brought it up.

	I think that's conflating content creation and curation somewhat. I actually agree curation is important, and strongly support R&D of better social technologies for curation. And I would even say that monetary incentives are *underutilized* on the curation side.

	Social media approval is as good as your curator set. Right now having good curators is definitely not a default, but I think it could get there over time. And trusting traditional info authorities as curators is deeply problematic in its own ways.

	But what if every monetization strategy either (i) earns you $4.75 even for an article that gets thousands of views, or (ii) inherently requires polluting or restricting the content in some way that heavily decreases its value?

	Yes, but the desire for social capital can incentivize positive-sum activity. Technically money is zero-sum too, but it's easy to see how that doesn't imply that the entire economy is a waste of time.

bitcoin ethereum 	I wrote hundreds of articles for bitcoin magazine for far below minimum wage, if not free, before starting ethereum.

	Part of me feels that interest in content monetization may be misguided.

	I also think the industry is moving toward mining or other forms of work and rewarding/airdropping to devs/community members.

	Yes, they definitely implied that its status changed. I've been parsing a lot of the statements carefully, and they seem to differentiate between the offering and the token, calling sales securities offerings generally, but indicating today that ETH no longer would be a security	laurashin	0	0	1529034980	1007471845040271360	https://twitter.com/laurashin/status/1007471845040271360			
	I get everything you said here but am not sure how they would define the centralized vs. decentralized -- as you can see on crypto Twitter, a lot of people have different opinions on what is centralized vs. what is not	laurashin	0	0	1529034403	1007469423593119750	https://twitter.com/laurashin/status/1007469423593119750			
	I think they'll do tokens on a case by case basis, but I wonder about the sales. So far a lot of the rhetoric has been that every ICO was a securities offering. They may go the Wyoming route and say the network at least has to be live or something.	laurashin	6	3	1529034188	1007468525277962240	https://twitter.com/laurashin/status/1007468525277962240			
	Yes, the next questions are whether all ICOs were securities offerings or if that will be case by case and how they determine whether something is sufficiently decentralized to not satisfy the fourth prong. (And what they'll do about XRP.)	laurashin	13	2	1529032818	1007462775138889728	https://twitter.com/laurashin/status/1007462775138889728

	Jerry's much better placed than I to answer this, but I'm sure the SEC would maintain that just because it chose not to enforce now does not preclude it from doing so to others. Fairness doesn't matter.

	"I'll take the latter. The others seem pointless if global inclusion is yr goal. But, then, I'm not sure SEC is clear on what defines a ""decentralized network."" When does it exist?

ethereum 	I agree. The SEC would open a can of worms if it went after Ethereum Foundation members now. (I hear champagne pops in Brooklyn). But also a clear message to anyone going forward: until you've got network relevance, your token offering is of a security. You have to register.

	There would be one LCD iPhone and two OLED iPhones this year.

	書きました。結局、消費者のほとんどはスマホの画面が液晶なのか有機ELかなんて気にしませんよね。今年はiPhoneXと同じような姿をした、でもお求めやすいお値段の、iPhoneが出てくるようです。アップルも液晶モデルのほうが有機ELモデルより売れると見ているようです。 https://www.wsj.com/articles/iphone-x-pensive-apple-looks-to-keep-phones-with-cheaper-displays-1529051835 …	mochi_wsj	10	10	1529052382	1007544835375370240	https://twitter.com/mochi_wsj/status/1007544835375370240

bitcoin 	That doesn't seem like a balanced argument. Bitcoin is a very clear contract: you know exactly what you are buying. The source code is available. And it works as money. It was used to fund Wikileaks when the world blockaded their banking infrastructure.

	You can suggest this isn't very useful - that the State being able to blockade dissident organizations with impunity is fine. I'm more of the opinion that, at this point in history, nearly any measure which moves power away from the State level is good and healthy.

bitcoin 	The absence of central authorities in blockchain is huge - the ability to convene essentially political power without central authorities is entirely new. Bitcoin really is a new class of entities: opt in software defined law, and monetary policy.	leashless	0	0	1529048305	1007527735571439616	https://twitter.com/leashless/status/1007527735571439616			
	Dave, *central banking without state authority* is a unique outcome - a citizen issued currency with locked in programmatic monetary policy is a huge innovation. Ditto the secure multiparty computation aspect of this. There's literally no other protocol with these attributes.	leashless	0	0	1529048206	1007527319982964736	https://twitter.com/leashless/status/1007527319982964736

	I have very mixed feelings about tariffs on China. I'm strongly pro free trade, and see no reason for tariffs on our allies for instance.

	In other words, the threat of personal damage (like the enticement of personal gain) guides US policy making rather than at least a perceived public interest.	prchovanec	0	0	1529024678	1007428635882553344	https://twitter.com/prchovanec/status/1007428635882553344			
	And I have no problem with that, on its own merits. But not as leverage against US policy, not matter how ill-conceived it may be. It can end up being a form of corruption in reverse.	prchovanec	0	0	1529024564	1007428157488672768	https://twitter.com/prchovanec/status/1007428157488672768

	Because while I think Trump has been behaving in a corrupt manner, we have laws in the US that we should work through, long before looking to international sanctions. And it’s tangential to the trade dispute between the US and Canada, however wrong Trump may be on the issue.	prchovanec	0	0	1529024388	1007427419303743489	https://twitter.com/prchovanec/status/1007427419303743489
