	Ultimately their problem is going to come down to differentiating themselves and getting traction (ie. adoption) in a very crowded altcoin space.

bitcoin 	What questions? There isn’t a universally agreed upon definition for “blockchain.” Bitcoin’s blockchain, THE BLOCKCHAIN, uses a “hash tree” which you seemed to think was a disqualifier. It’s not. And how other people use their crypto isn’t any of our business. Banks included.	haydentiff	2	0	1520906989	973380581500293122	https://twitter.com/haydentiff/status/973380581500293122

ripple 	When people (unsuccessfully) attempt to be clever by claiming that Ripple isn't a blockchain, this is my standard snarky reply: Ripple has superior ledger data structures and there is a good argument to be made that calling it a mere blockchain is belittling and minimizing.	haydentiff	5	0	1520904931	973371947353624576	https://twitter.com/haydentiff/status/973371947353624576			
bitcoin ripple 	What on earth are you reading? Lol. Hash trees are Merkle trees, which both Bitcoin and Ripple use (and by Ripple I mean the XRPL). People can use $ XRP for whatever they want.

	Let me make it explicit: Roll your own crypto. Roll your own consensus protocol. Roll your own database. That's how we get progress.

	"The subtlety of the tweet is lost on some people with ""fragile egos,"" but the tweet says the opposite of ""don't roll your own crypto."" If people did that, we'd have no crypto.

	If you're smart, you roll your own crypto or consensus protocol. How hard could it be? If you're very smart, you will know that that's a bad idea.

	Problem is Beijing lies so commonly as standard operating procedure and no one believes them, when they do tell the truth no one believes them. Same problem writ large. This is why non-traditional information sources flourish.
