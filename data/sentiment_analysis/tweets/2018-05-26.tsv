	It requires a strong anti-sybil metric; otherwise you can buy many tickets at low probabilities, and get a high probability at a low price as most of the tickets other than the one you use will be refunded.

	There is also the indirect bearing that all economic nodes have via credible threat to cause chaos by not accepting a dominant invalid chain by default, but that just requires *some* way to learn what blocks are invalid, not direct validation.

	The only node whose rejection has any direct bearing on the rest of the network is a miner/validator. The system is secure against up to 33-50% attacks on the validatimg layer.	VitalikButerin	15	3	1527308977	1000232465540136960	https://twitter.com/VitalikButerin/status/1000232465540136960

	Once again, the sharding system does not give a crap about nodes. It only inherently recognizes validators with deposited stake. So if you spin up 150k nodes, you'll just have 150k backups of some shard, and the other 5k nodes will keep running the network as before.

	Looks like someone added about 20% to BTG. Not enough to pull off a 51% attack. Hey # BTG folks, do any of you have detailed logs from your blockchain?

	@ elonmusk someone should be selling merchandise. It’s good stuff but it’s kind of there. I think you should have a retail section. Like Porsche design. The brand is super strong.

	People hate on # LebronJames they hate on # ElonMusk. They hate seeing people do amazing things. Why? A sad jealousy. Don’t let that cloud your mind from reality.

	Bottom line is @ elonmusk is a genius. If he can get this line running to 5k a week but really 10k a week. They will sell every car. This is an amazing car. Great job Elon.

	Basically everyone in the world is going to want this car. The price point is amazing for what you get. It’s the most advanced mass produced car ever made. At $55k it’s was worth it. At $35k for get about it. It will sell out forever. # tesla # model3 $ tsla	GerberKawasaki	97	22	1527369914	1000488052513386496	https://twitter.com/GerberKawasaki/status/1000488052513386496		# #

	The interface is simple and Apple style. Takes 5 minutes to get set up & used to it. My kid was working the screen in seconds. No keys or buttons is weird but amazing.

	The clear roofs and huge windshield gives you a large view of everything. Only thing is there is not a ton of visibility behind because of the way it’s designed but no one is passing you anyways.

	It’s really comfy. Great seats. The car feels substantial. Nothing cheap feeling in it. For $55k it kills the BMW and Mercedes of the same class. Good steering wheel. Plenty of room in the car.

	It’s quiet. I came from a loud car with a huge engine. It’s amazing how quiet it is. But you lose track on how fast you’re going as it’s so responsive.

	The car is fast. Faster than I thought. It jumps off the line like a tiger. It handled well I’m on 18” wheels. It brakes great. In fact you don’t use the breaks a lot because of regenerating breaking. When I slammed on them they worked fine. Stopped fast. # tesla # model3 $ tsla	GerberKawasaki	52	5	1527369119	1000484717718749184	https://twitter.com/GerberKawasaki/status/1000484717718749184		# #

	So in summary my best guess... slowish bleed down to $6800... then a steeper slide to $5700, then a levelling out of the drop... then a flat zone. This is an educated guess based on volume profile and fundamental data framing the rate of movement. /11pic.twitter.com/jeei1L9FAM	woonomic	93	37	1527306851	1000223547158093824	https://twitter.com/woonomic/status/1000223547158093824			
	2014 had a 2-phase drop. I doubt we'll see that this time around. I think we'll see this center section cut out. Next up cycle will take less time. Q3/Q4 2018 IMO /10pic.twitter.com/AZLKz6b7JT	woonomic	43	13	1527306850	1000223544758894592	https://twitter.com/woonomic/status/1000223544758894592			
	I don't concur with the notion that BTC is a market on long time frames, it's an adoption curve - we see climb, consolidation, climb, consolidation. Traditional markets tend to be at saturation, when price action is more sideways. Therefore BTC lends itself to being forecasted /9	woonomic	36	9	1527306850	1000223543655915520	https://twitter.com/woonomic/status/1000223543655915520			
	This is like 2014 but Y-axis is just 20x LOL. In some ways the markets are more reliable to forecast in 2018 than in 2014. Data on fundamentals should map more reliably to price as we ain't in the early phase of a few whales randomly pushing things around anymore. /8	woonomic	27	5	1527306850	1000223542661779458	https://twitter.com/woonomic/status/1000223542661779458			
	I don't necessarily think we'll fall through the 5000s... sure it's a possibility but it doesn't have to. It's not a repeat, it's not Mt Gox and Willybot pushing up price with faked orders, we aren't detoxing from a scam bubble. Technically $5000s is a very strong support band /7	woonomic	32	7	1527306850	1000223541411942401	https://twitter.com/woonomic/status/1000223541411942401			
	When I run the above scenarios against detoxing at a $6800-$7000 floor, it seems a very unlikely path we'll play out at the $7000 level. This is given the time we need for NVT and volatility to baseline. /6	woonomic	13	4	1527306849	1000223540111663104	https://twitter.com/woonomic/status/1000223540111663104

	3) This is further supported with Standard NVT being way high, we have time to burn to bring it down. /4pic.twitter.com/Lf3kfhkAPP	woonomic	20	5	1527306848	1000223535640600579	https://twitter.com/woonomic/status/1000223535640600579			
	2) Volatility is still too high. I'm looking for a sustained low band of volatility which tends to be a signal for the end of the detox and the next accumulation phase. It's still got some time to ride down. /3pic.twitter.com/Z953G4YKvI	woonomic	43	14	1527306848	1000223533388193792	https://twitter.com/woonomic/status/1000223533388193792			
	1) NVT Signal is still too high. We need more blockchain transactional activity to justify the current price, or the price to drop to reconcile the difference. To drive up transactional activity in a bear slide is very unlikely IMO. /2pic.twitter.com/pyVl6NpUYf	woonomic	27	7	1527306847	1000223530703839232	https://twitter.com/woonomic/status/1000223530703839232			
	I think we are gonna go to $5500-5700 next, I can't see $7000 holding. Most likely we'll balance a bit, then we'll slide through. Long timeframes here, looking into June for rough timing of this to play out at a best guess. /1pic.twitter.com/pCN0N97vp6	woonomic	398	156	1527306847	1000223528803762176	https://twitter.com/woonomic/status/1000223528803762176
