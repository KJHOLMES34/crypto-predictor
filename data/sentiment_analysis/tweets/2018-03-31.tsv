	Of course underlying this is the fact that President Trump just doesn't like Amazon's CEO because he also owns the Washington Post which has been critical in its coverage of him. He makes this highly questionable motivation perfectly clear in his tweets.	prchovanec	12	8	1522515876	980128739534299136	https://twitter.com/prchovanec/status/980128739534299136			
	"Are you ""taking advantage of"" the airline if they have empty seats on a plane that they're better off selling to you cheap, versus flying with them empty? Of course not."	prchovanec	6	4	1522515781	980128344111919104	https://twitter.com/prchovanec/status/980128344111919104			
	But that's really a question of how the US Postal Service is managed, not whether Amazon is taking advantage of them or not.	prchovanec	1	2	1522515583	980127514344423425	https://twitter.com/prchovanec/status/980127514344423425			
	Of course, it's fair to note that costs that are fixed in the short-term become variable in the longer-term. So it's a fair question to ask whether the Post Office has too much (subsidized) capacity that it is incentivized to fill too cheaply, or not.	prchovanec	2	2	1522515515	980127225302470656	https://twitter.com/prchovanec/status/980127225302470656			
	The correct basis for evaluation whether the US Post Office wins or loses from its contracts with Amazon isn't AVERAGE cost (which Trump is citing) but MARGINAL cost. Is the additional cost incurred more or less than the additional revenue earned?	prchovanec	17	6	1522515398	980126734971531264	https://twitter.com/prchovanec/status/980126734971531264			
	The US Post Office also has a massive amount of fixed capacity. Amazon utilizing that capacity costs the Post Office only a bit more than it already must spend, while bringing in a lot more revenue.	prchovanec	10	6	1522515293	980126296440295425	https://twitter.com/prchovanec/status/980126296440295425			
	Once you've already paid for a certain amount of capacity (like a plane flying from NY to LA), your costs are largely fixed. The cost of selling an additional ticket on that flight is very small. Filling an empty seat, at virtually any price, is a plus for the airline.	prchovanec	14	3	1522515139	980125648881582080	https://twitter.com/prchovanec/status/980125648881582080			
	I'd just like to note that a lot of people pay less for their air ticket than the average cost of flying each passenger. According to Trump's logic, this should be illegal.https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/980063581592047617 …	prchovanec	24	12	1522515021	980125157271441408	https://twitter.com/prchovanec/status/980125157271441408

	I also bristle at the idea that Trumpism is just populism. I think that's an attempt to dodge the way Trumpism was created and sustained by cult-like behavior that is fundamentally dangerous and far beyond the populist streak that runs through both US parties.

	Seems to me Rich is saying: Look, you can either have a GOP or you can be Never Trump, but you can't be both, because this is here to stay and it's just another cycle of populism. I reject that.

	A false choice. First, Trumpism isn’t just another iteration of “populism.” Second, no one thinks the GOP will return to where it once was.
