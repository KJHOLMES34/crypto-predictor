bitcoin 	Before anyone gets bent out of shape about PoW criticism, here's a final thought experiment: suppose there was a unicorn that could do everything Bitcoin could do, as securely, but used 1/1000th its energy. Would you switch to it, or would you burn the energy for the hell of it?	el33th4xor	26	3	1527073349	999244167401308160	https://twitter.com/el33th4xor/status/999244167401308160

	Which why I'm very excited about Avalanche and related family of protocols. They do away with mining, and have the potential to open up validation to thousands of participants without energy waste.	el33th4xor	13	3	1527067641	999220229531107329	https://twitter.com/el33th4xor/status/999220229531107329			
	While PoW is all energy-wasted in the absence of attacks, and while PoW is inherently centralizing, it was also the only protocol that actually worked. Until recently, we had nothing that could effectively compete with PoW. PoS (and variant) designs have been fragile.	el33th4xor	10	2	1527067573	999219943651598336	https://twitter.com/el33th4xor/status/999219943651598336			
	"This explains BTC's love-hate relationship with its miners: their ""decentralization above all else"" credo conflicts with the inherently centralized nature of PoW.

	There's nothing in common with the skills required to acquire mining rigs / gain access to cheap electricity, and checking and ordering transactions.

	The answer is resoundingly yes. There's nothing that the excess hardware does for the coin, and there's nothing that a miner does for transactions any one of you could not do.	el33th4xor	7	1	1527066786	999216639974498304	https://twitter.com/el33th4xor/status/999216639974498304			
	A simple thought experiment: if the miners agreed and protocol allowed, could all of them turn off half their hash power and keep it in reserve to deter future attacks?	el33th4xor	7	3	1527066785	999216638342901760	https://twitter.com/el33th4xor/status/999216638342901760			
	"I interpret ""attack"" liberally here. Miners working to increase their share of the reward pie can also be considered an attack."	el33th4xor	5	1	1527066785	999216637034319872	https://twitter.com/el33th4xor/status/999216637034319872

bitcoin 	I don't view Satoshi's word as scripture and don't believe the community should either. Things were very different early on, including the context of discussions and the assumptions made.

	Q7: 最近ハマっているゲームは？ A7: 私はどちらかというとひどいプレイヤーだ（笑）。ヘタなりの楽しみ方はあるが、上手い人のプレイを見るのが楽しい。こういう遊び方があるんだ、とか、楽しみつつ新しい気付きもたくさんある。見ていて楽しいコンテンツが増えたことには勇気づけられる。 （了）	mochi_wsj	9	6	1527069256	999227001712984066	https://twitter.com/mochi_wsj/status/999227001712984066			
	Q6: VRはどうか？ A6: PSVRは販売を伸ばしているが、市場全体として過度な期待感に対する修正が入っている時期という認識だ。しかし、VRのポテンシャルを見極めた人はいないと思っているので、投資などを投資引き続き率先していきたい。それがひいてはPSプラットフォームの付加価値となる。	mochi_wsj	14	17	1527069256	999227000660217858	https://twitter.com/mochi_wsj/status/999227000660217858			
	Q5: Vitaの後継機は？ A5: 現時点でポータブル機について具体的に話せる内容は無い。モバイルも考慮した新しいゲームのあり方、ゲーム体験のあり方という視点だ。	mochi_wsj	14	25	1527069256	999226999733338112	https://twitter.com/mochi_wsj/status/999226999733338112			
	ネットで繋がっている世界なので全部含めた中でどういう体験をやっていくかということで考えている。たとえば、プレイリンクのようにコンソールとスマホの連携を楽しんでもらうとか、色々模索している。その延長線上でポータブル（戦略）は固まってくると思う。	mochi_wsj	12	13	1527069255	999226998739288064	https://twitter.com/mochi_wsj/status/999226998739288064			
	Q4: 携帯機は？ A4: 携帯「機」というハードに特化した見方というよりかはモビリティというか、モバイルのプラットフォームと、PSのような据え置きのコンソールがある中で、いろいろな機器を含めどういうゲーム体験を提供できるかという視点のほうが良い。（続く）	mochi_wsj	14	17	1527069255	999226997749379073	https://twitter.com/mochi_wsj/status/999226997749379073			
	Q3: コンソールにはこだわらない？ A3: コンソールに特化して話すのは難しい。Nowがあったり、色々な形でゲームを楽しんでいただく、オプションを増やすのが使命。デジタルにこれからこれに切り替わる、というのではなく、いろいろな形で楽しんでもらえるようプラットフォームを柔軟にしていく戦略だ。	mochi_wsj	9	12	1527069255	999226996675694592	https://twitter.com/mochi_wsj/status/999226996675694592			
	Q2: 今中期中には次世代機は出さないということか？ A2: 答えられない。が、歴代のコンソールライフサイクルとは違った見方が必要だ。PSの未来を考える時、コンソールだけとか、ネットワークだけとか、切り離して考えるのが難しい時代だ。次のPSのあり方を考えるのがこの3年間と思っている。	mochi_wsj	9	17	1527069255	999226995601899520	https://twitter.com/mochi_wsj/status/999226995601899520			
	Q1: 次世代機のタイミングは？ A1: 現時点で話すことはない。メッセージとしてはいわゆるソニーの3年サイクルの中期経営計画で考えると我々の事業はもうちょっと長いので語りきれないところがある。今回の中期（21年3月まで）は一旦かがんでより高くための準備期間というふうに考えている。	mochi_wsj	11	20	1527069254	999226994259705856	https://twitter.com/mochi_wsj/status/999226994259705856

	You should actually read the thread properly, I said I doubt that would happen, we'd likely hold up much higher, the top two green bands in the chart.	woonomic	3	1	1527107312	999386620116852736	https://twitter.com/woonomic/status/999386620116852736			
	That's my framing of the market right now. It's a mix of chart technicals, NVT, fractal patterning and fundamentals wrapped up as an educated guess. PS.

	So yeah, $3.5k-$4.4k maybe, but I'm thinking we'll hold up higher, I think $5.5k-$6k region at worst. Just a guess, not a model. Green bands are these candidates for the final unwind. We'll know when NVT normalises back into its proper range, that'll be the bottom. /6pic.twitter.com/cvQTOlcHXH	woonomic	95	24	1527106919	999384971117846528	https://twitter.com/woonomic/status/999384971117846528

	But in 2018 I see none of the weakness of 2014. Those down-whiskers in 2014 were pretty tragic, buyers were weak. Here in 2018 the whiskers are very muted.

	The question to ask is whether we can unwind from Dec 2017's mania in the $6k-$7k range, or that fails and we're forced to consolidate lower like in 2014. This was the moment of truth in 2014. When support broke and we were forced to unwind at the lower levels... /2pic.twitter.com/jRIzJ4eyTW	woonomic	22	7	1527106917	999384964297830400	https://twitter.com/woonomic/status/999384964297830400

	It's a combo of previous support on volume profiles, fractal patterning and a lot of weight on NVT as a fundamental (not technical) indicator. The latter two are longer range predictors.
