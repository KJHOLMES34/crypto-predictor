bitcoin 	ICOs are tokens issued on a public Blockchain. They are part of the crypto sector. I’m referring to Bitcoin, Altcoin’s and Tokens. Everything trades back to Bitcoin so I consider it all part of the crypto pie mainly used as Currency, asset, commodity, protocol and technology.

	You're putting the political cart before the market horse. The power of unions largely derives from the market scarcity of labor, as does their weakness.

	LOL, the desire to pay as little as possible is true of all buyers in all markets. Yet somehow scarcity of supply gets in the way.	prchovanec	1	0	1525441497	992399683124453376	https://twitter.com/prchovanec/status/992399683124453376			
	Yes, but that may or may not be indicative of how tight labor markets are. It depends on whether those people are positioned to readily reenter the labor market or not.	prchovanec	0	0	1525441294	992398831680663552	https://twitter.com/prchovanec/status/992398831680663552			
	"Labor scarcity (supply vs demand) is directly relevant to that question. In fact, I'd argue the ""political"" power of workers in the labor markets (e.g., unionization) derives far more than the underlying economics than many think."	prchovanec	1	0	1525441062	992397859990458368	https://twitter.com/prchovanec/status/992397859990458368			
	While US jobs growth in April (164k) fell below expectations, the average monthly gain so far this year is 200k, which is higher than the past two years. Anything mid-100k range is decent, and far from alarming, especially at this stage of the business cycle.	prchovanec	5	1	1525440173	992394130247610368	https://twitter.com/prchovanec/status/992394130247610368

	Two years ago, it was a struggle between strong consumption growth and sluggish investment. Which would pull the other in its direction?

	At 3.9%,, the US unemployment rate is now the lowest since December 2000. At that time, wages were rising at +4.3% y/y, compared to just +2.6% y/y today. It continues to be a mystery why we're not seeing more upward pressure on wages, contributing to broader inflation.	prchovanec	55	20	1525438974	992389100996120577	https://twitter.com/prchovanec/status/992389100996120577			
	As for the new railway to Hail (and eventually Jordan), it's part of a big expansion taking place. I asked but have not gotten a clear answer yet on whether the Chinese are involved or not (at least in providing the rolling stock).	prchovanec	1	1	1525436841	992380157125189632	https://twitter.com/prchovanec/status/992380157125189632			
	After WW2, against US advice (we suggested highways would generate a better return) Ibn Saud insisted on building a railroad from Dhahran (where the oil fields were) to Riyadh. It was one of his biggest pet projects, and involved a lot of difficult engineering challenges.	prchovanec	1	1	1525436650	992379354733793281	https://twitter.com/prchovanec/status/992379354733793281			
	So railroads were associated with modernity, and King Abdul Aziz Ibd Saud, the founder of modern Saudi Arabia (more on him later), had a real thing for them. /2 -	prchovanec	2	1	1525436552	992378946338611200	https://twitter.com/prchovanec/status/992378946338611200			
	So this (trains in Saudi Arabia) is an interesting issue. It goes all the way back to the Hejaz Railroad built under the Turks just before WWI, now fallen into disuse.
