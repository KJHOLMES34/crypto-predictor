ripple 	You say guarantee like everyone is cooperating. You can't assume that in an adversarial network. If only Ripple validators are in your UNL (which is the default setup), your XRP are effectively taken (or at least unspendable).	jimmysong	9	2	1521863280	977391554649206785	https://twitter.com/jimmysong/status/977391554649206785			
	I never claimed that's the only function of validators. You asked me how it can lie, I told you how it can lie. The rest of what you're commenting on are irrelevant points.

ripple 	Then answer my question. Is rippled controlled by Ripple or not? This is getting very tiresome. If you're not going to answer the question, then I don't see why I should be accommodating. I can't debate someone who refuses to stand for anything.	jimmysong	30	1	1521856762	977364216704262144	https://twitter.com/jimmysong/status/977364216704262144			
ripple 	And I've asked you to verify my assertions first. If you believe that rippled is not controlled by Ripple, then what does it matter that I point to code? You're just going to say that's not the real code or that users are supposed to code their own.	jimmysong	17	1	1521856565	977363390812205057	https://twitter.com/jimmysong/status/977363390812205057			
ripple 	I thought I was the one waiting. I'm still wanting to know who controls the rippled GitHub. If your answer is no one, then please say so. So far I've asked you this 3 times and you have deflected each time.	jimmysong	36	3	1521856262	977362118818258945	https://twitter.com/jimmysong/status/977362118818258945

ripple 	Sorry if I'm sounding patronizing, I'm not meaning to. I don't know you or what facts you would agree is true. I assure you I'm asking these questions because I want to waste the least amount of time. Am I accurate in saying rippled is controlled by Ripple?	jimmysong	16	1	1521855519	977359003218075648	https://twitter.com/jimmysong/status/977359003218075648

	The USA gets less competitive as we spend more on special interests. Pork barreling should not be additive. It should be trade offs for other items in the budget.	TimDraper	28	8	1521903767	977561370655907841	https://twitter.com/TimDraper/status/977561370655907841

	So, if they want to spend more on defense, they have to spend less on health care. Right now, all they do is raise our taxes and put us deeper into debt.	TimDraper	57	11	1521903456	977560065933758465	https://twitter.com/TimDraper/status/977560065933758465

	I place very little technical importance to the breaking of a diagonal trendline. It could mean: 1. Previous trend is reversing, or 2. Period of morphing and consolidation is ahead, or 3.
