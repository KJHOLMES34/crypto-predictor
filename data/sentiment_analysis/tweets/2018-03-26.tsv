	Not have Visa debit card was not a warning sign. Like I said previously, I was never that excited about the card and never hyped that news.	SatoshiLite	12	3	1522100370	978385983396757504	https://twitter.com/SatoshiLite/status/978385983396757504			
litecoin 	I cannot be excited about a company working on supporting Litecoin? Get out of here! And LTC will surpass BCH without LitePay's help.	SatoshiLite	119	38	1522100229	978385392658300928	https://twitter.com/SatoshiLite/status/978385392658300928			
	The Visa card delay was announced last month. We didn't expect LitePat to close up shop and not actually do the merchant processing part of its business.	SatoshiLite	12	2	1522100045	978384621678112769	https://twitter.com/SatoshiLite/status/978384621678112769

	They were public. The copied website, the lack of transparency, lack of communication, and finally the AMA that didn't answer anything. Everything was public.	SatoshiLite	13	3	1522098602	978378568655822848	https://twitter.com/SatoshiLite/status/978378568655822848

	I don't think advertising your product is necessarily a bad thing but the fact that there are thousands of coins beyond the number of engineers possibly there to build them necessarily mean that most of them can't be built in near future.	stacyherbert	2	0	1522081446	978306611663048705	https://twitter.com/stacyherbert/status/978306611663048705

	Just because it's the 'biggest' doesn't mean it's not a scam or at least as stupid as http://Pets.com  or http://TheGlobe.com  which was also the biggest one day IPO pump on the day it went public.

bitcoin 	Bitcoin doesn't have a marketing team so won't have any impact on the one crypto I'm interested in personally. Re: the ICOs, while I'm not interested in them, I assume any that had to advertise was probably a scam anyway so good decision by TWTR.	stacyherbert	20	2	1522076975	978287858921426944	https://twitter.com/stacyherbert/status/978287858921426944
