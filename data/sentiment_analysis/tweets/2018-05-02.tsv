ripple 	“Blockchain is a 'pixie dust' fad.” That’s what the non-biased reporters wrote about. Martin Walker hates blockchain technology, not @ Ripple specifically. He says # blockchain tech has made people “switch off their brains and stop thinking.” He must read CoinDesk articles. $ XRPhttps://twitter.com/coindesk/status/991507170503086081 …	haydentiff	117	35	1525229810	991511805536231425	https://twitter.com/haydentiff/status/991511805536231425		#	@
