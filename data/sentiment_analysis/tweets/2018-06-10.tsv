	Until we see a decoupling from BTC, even projects with strong fundamentals will suffer from negative BTC sentiment until they have their own independent adoption cycles with organic demand driving supply/demand driven market pricing. I call this consumptive demand.	VinnyLingham	198	30	1528665644	1005922739612368896	https://twitter.com/VinnyLingham/status/1005922739612368896			
	Bear markets in technology occur when sentiment > actual adoption, which is what matters. Patience beats sentiment in the long run if you’re betting on strong fundamentals.

	7/ This is rent seeking at its purest. What's worse is that there's a conflation between these tokens an BTC. Centralized money and Decentralized sound money. They shouldn't be conflated. They're really, really different yet are placed in the same general category: cryptocurrency	jimmysong	105	17	1528667963	1005932464970313728	https://twitter.com/jimmysong/status/1005932464970313728			
	5/ This has skewed the BTC economy. Instead of lots of goods and service creators, there's a whole host of people trying to remake BTC so they can win in some smaller domain. They're aiming to become the central bank for a new currency and get all the benefits of doing so.	jimmysong	75	6	1528667766	1005931636813455360	https://twitter.com/jimmysong/status/1005931636813455360			
bitcoin 	"4/ Instead, what's happened is that there are still lots of people that want to be ""money creators"" without the expense of mining. What do they do? They create altcoins, ICOs or token sales. They want to become the centralized version of Bitcoin. They aim to be sound money."	jimmysong	95	16	1528667647	1005931138966347783	https://twitter.com/jimmysong/status/1005931138966347783			
bitcoin 	3/ In bitcoin, you have the same dynamics as gold. It's very expensive to get into Bitcoin mining. You would think this would lead to a lot more people trying to provide goods and services people want.	jimmysong	48	6	1528667500	1005930523309559810	https://twitter.com/jimmysong/status/1005930523309559810			
	2/ Creating money does not add to society, creating goods and services does. With Gold, for example, gold mining is really expensive and not that much effort is expended on it. With USD, lots of people are in banking because they essentially get to benefit from money printing.	jimmysong	65	9	1528667441	1005930275304505347	https://twitter.com/jimmysong/status/1005930275304505347			
	1/ In every form of money, there are two ways to make money: 1. Create more of the money 2. Create a good or service that people want	jimmysong	322	72	1528667331	1005929815478808581	https://twitter.com/jimmysong/status/1005929815478808581			
	"Anyway, I didn't intend this to be a tweetstorm, but I disagree with this assertion that the ""smart devs"" are working on ETH or AUGER or something else. I just don't see it."	jimmysong	27	1	1528665698	1005922964896993280	https://twitter.com/jimmysong/status/1005922964896993280			
bitcoin 	The people that wanted to make *Bitcoin* better and not trying to sell tokens of one type or another have stayed. What I've noticed is that the good devs are the ones trying to make Bitcoin better. The bad ones generally try to sell more or less useless stuff.	jimmysong	41	1	1528665637	1005922707777687552	https://twitter.com/jimmysong/status/1005922707777687552			
bitcoin 	"There has always been people that have been coding to make Bitcoin better. There have always been people trying to ""get rich"" by creating their own token starting way back with altcoins in 2011. The latter group moved to ETH because it was a better platform for them."	jimmysong	46	5	1528665530	1005922259297501184	https://twitter.com/jimmysong/status/1005922259297501184			
bitcoin 	Third, the Coinbase API is hardly the bastion of developer activity. Real development was going on in wallets, alternate implementations and of course Bitcoin core. The people in those things, did they move to ETH? Perhaps, but I don't recall many.	jimmysong	26	1	1528665441	1005921885056618498	https://twitter.com/jimmysong/status/1005921885056618498			
bitcoin 	Second, Vitalik wasn't as much a dev as he was a writer. He wrote lots for Bitcoin Magazine, for example. Yes, he wrote a Python Bitcoin Library, but have you looked at the code? It's almost like it's written by an amateur 19-year-old with zero software development experience!	jimmysong	74	8	1528665301	1005921301284970496	https://twitter.com/jimmysong/status/1005921301284970496			
	"First, I haven't heard of Augur, Zepplin and Decentraland other than some some token that raised some money. Raising money doesn't mean you're a ""smart dev"" any more than it makes you a ""smart accountant"" or ""smart lawyer"" or ""smart manager"". They haven't built much that ppl use."	jimmysong	48	6	1528665171	1005920754565820418	https://twitter.com/jimmysong/status/1005920754565820418			
	"I concur with @ TheBlueMatt and @ lopp. I really can't think of ""smart BTC devs"" that shifted focus. Most went from Mastercoin, Counterparty and other similar projects or were completely new."	jimmysong	43	3	1528663531	1005913874208641024	https://twitter.com/jimmysong/status/1005913874208641024			@ @

	actually, nevermind. I don't think this can work because the final PoW has to record this somehow and there's no way to make it not cheat. It can say it didn't see any shares even if it did.	jimmysong	1	0	1528595856	1005630024396017664	https://twitter.com/jimmysong/status/1005630024396017664			
	You could change to a high share threshold. You could probably reduce the need to store the data permanently and can be thrown out after verifying. Bandwidth you can reduce by having people essentially mine similar blocks. Verification is the killer. Each share has to be verified	jimmysong	1	0	1528595524	1005628631815806976	https://twitter.com/jimmysong/status/1005628631815806976			
	Let's see. You could do something at the protocol level, but it would be very expensive. Essentially every qualifying share would have to get recorded and that used to pay people out when Proof of Work actually gets found. You could soft fork this, but it's massively wasteful.	jimmysong	1	0	1528595129	1005626975925493762	https://twitter.com/jimmysong/status/1005626975925493762

	Fame, too, gets too much respect and character not enough. Being known doesn't mean being wise. These shortcuts we use to evaluate a person's importance need serious reconsideration.	jimmysong	315	65	1528582202	1005572756442959875	https://twitter.com/jimmysong/status/1005572756442959875

	The report stated that more people are using $ BTC as cash and $ BCH as an investment. I thought that was interesting. 90% HODL with $ BCH. 1:1 with $ BTC.

Agree that ‘store of value, in # Bitcoin world is not trying to preserve value like gold but more increase value like an investment. # Bitcoin is so many things to do many people, it’s just a question of how most people want to use it in the end.

	OK. So you reject Greahams Law? That’s all we are debating really. I do like the focus on merchant adoption that makes $ BCH different which is a worthy goal, I just don’t see how it ends differently if it succeeds at its goal.

bitcoin 	Because nobody wants to be # Bitcoin pizza guy. I do spend a lot of # Bitcoin for ideological reasons but it’s not a good financial decision.

	Well good cash is a bad investment as it should not go up in value so people spend. It would be great if $ BCH achieves stable pricing to make it good cash. That will be great for the eco-system and very few reasons to hold it over spending it.

	I have no problem with pushing the cash usercase. I like the goals of pushing merchant adoption.

bitcoin 	“90% of $ BCH is held by hodlers” @ chainalysis - exactly why # Bitcoin became a store of value - nobody wants to be # Bitcoin pizza guy so if it gets adoption people stop spending money they think will be worth more and instead spend money they think will be worth less eg. $ USD etc.pic.twitter.com/1DoeYBCERR	SimonDixonTwitt	32	7	1528619078	1005727424833900544	https://twitter.com/SimonDixonTwitt/status/1005727424833900544		# #	@

	What I wrote is right. BTW, what happens when voting reaches, say, 13%, and two votes come in, one for X, representing 5%, and another for Y, representing 5%.

	Cryptonihilism: because the set of goals you want to achieve are impossible, or perhaps very difficult, and in any case, beyond your abilities, claiming that no one should even try using crypto for that problem.	el33th4xor	137	33	1528655054	1005878318820937728	https://twitter.com/el33th4xor/status/1005878318820937728			
	ETH's security doesn't depend on its history. I summarized my concerns here: https://twitter.com/el33th4xor/status/1005701273767874560?s=19 … It's odd that the bootstrap relies on a centralized server, when stronger crypto could have eliminated trust.	el33th4xor	1	1	1528642102	1005823993629298690	https://twitter.com/el33th4xor/status/1005823993629298690			
	That's not right. 1. You're not bootstrapping in the vacuum of space. You are already using ETH for bootstrapping the token economy. 2. If you don't want to use ETH, you can bootstrap with a large quorum. You don't need to be centralized.	el33th4xor	3	0	1528640947	1005819152303575040	https://twitter.com/el33th4xor/status/1005819152303575040			
	The use of a stronger voting mechanism would have avoided some of these concerns. Using a mechanism that's open to vote suppression converts problems that could have been resolved in-protocol into problems that have to be resolved in the messy, expensive social layer.	el33th4xor	1	0	1528635748	1005797346855325696	https://twitter.com/el33th4xor/status/1005797346855325696

	It's non-trivial to bootstrap a dPoS system, but there are many well understood techniques EOS could have used to make it's processes more robust and immune to criticism.

	No, the selection of a block at a given height has no bearing on future blocks in Nakamoto Consensus.

	Voting systems are designed carefully to avoid these kinds of vote suppression issues. If a vote comes down to a single node keeping a tally, that vote is not trustworthy even if the arithmetic that's visible in the tally adds up.

	In scenario 1, the system was to blame, in 2, I was a rogue actor. But the observable evidence is identical in both cases. Validating the chain only helps with safety concerns, not with liveness, and the issue being raised here is a selective liveness (aka censorship) problem.	el33th4xor	46	4	1528609635	1005687817983414277	https://twitter.com/el33th4xor/status/1005687817983414277

	Thanks for putting that together. Agree. These are distributions. Can be distilled down to a single number, a power law coefficient so to speak. That’s a single number to measure decentralisation of a repo.	woonomic	1	1	1528646560	1005842695191920640	https://twitter.com/woonomic/status/1005842695191920640

	Note that this is an imperfect measure. Commits are not apples for apples, some can be large contributions, some can be small. Though in these charts I'm more concerned about the drop off as a measure of centralisation, I think this approach is mainly valid.	woonomic	13	1	1528589189	1005602061772316673	https://twitter.com/woonomic/status/1005602061772316673			
bitcoin 	My hunch is that Bitcoin's contribution base is LESS centralised than most other coin projects. But this cannot be said without writing some code to analyse a large number of projects. A project for another time.	woonomic	17	0	1528589189	1005602060824383488	https://twitter.com/woonomic/status/1005602060824383488			
ethereum 	For example here's a quick comparison with Ethereum. Ethereum's drop off is much steeper, i.e. more centralised. Note the use of log scale for clearer visibility.pic.twitter.com/aVesfLEmPl	woonomic	30	2	1528589188	1005602058249138181	https://twitter.com/woonomic/status/1005602058249138181			
	There is a power law dynamic in contributions, a steeper drop-off implies centralisation of contributors, it would be useful to chart this across many leading projects.	woonomic	13	2	1528589188	1005602057229828102	https://twitter.com/woonomic/status/1005602057229828102

	I think that's a huge rationalization. It's a way of writing off the moral poverty of cheering on Trump by finding Deep Reasons. Get the steering wheel away from the child-king, then we can argue about which road to take.

	Plenty of adults have done that already. Even Trump's NSS isn't so bad - except that Trump has no idea what's in it, and wouldn't make it into policy if he did. It's not lack of thought, it's that a sizable chunk of America is too stupid and self-destructive to sustain a policy.
