bitcoin 	Example: it's really easy to say that 3 entities (incl. pools) control > 50% of the PoW hash rate for Bitcoin. What's a fair way to compare that to a system such as Steem, Lisk etc?	ummjackson	5	1	1520732156	972647278946131968	https://twitter.com/ummjackson/status/972647278946131968

	One question for everyone - what do you feel the best way to gauge distribution of consensus in a Proof of Stake system? Vote make up in last X blocks?
