	"Sharding doesn't care about number of ""nodes"" in the sense of self-declared computers. It assigns based on deposited stake."	VitalikButerin	3	1	1527285370	1000133450270031872	https://twitter.com/VitalikButerin/status/1000133450270031872			
	Not possible because you can't choose which portions of the blockchain you are assigned. If you wait until you literally have near 100% (realistically, you'll probably need 97-99% to pull this kind of attack off), then that's just another kind of 51% attack.

bitcoin 	False. Bitcoin cannot run solely on SPV clients because SPV clients can't mine (effectively), and there's still a bottleneck that the block creating entity has to process a load equal to the entire load of the network during that time. Sharding has none of these issues.	VitalikButerin	6	1	1527285304	1000133170656772096	https://twitter.com/VitalikButerin/status/1000133170656772096			
	And charity *is* decentralized; that's precisely the reason I think it's an important tool for plugging holes in public goods funding.	VitalikButerin	47	3	1527227348	999890088032006144	https://twitter.com/VitalikButerin/status/999890088032006144			
	Decentralization does not mean not having preferences about how others act. Everyone has those (don't you wish everyone would murder and cheat less?).

	Markets are great. But any mechanism for social resource allocation is inevitably imperfect, which is why we need multiple mechanisms, and hope they can cover each other's flaws.	VitalikButerin	10	1	1527226893	999888180601020416	https://twitter.com/VitalikButerin/status/999888180601020416			
	Honestly I don't give a crap how moral charity donors are. I care about how many millions of dollars are being put toward global poverty reduction, life extension research and x-risk research.

	Markets chronically underfund public goods. IMO governments too underfund the important ones. Here's a third possible funding mechanism that could plug the holes in the other two.

bitcoin 	Bitcoin creates 10 times more mining rewards than Bitcoin Cash. So if Bitcoin dies, all these miners will be fighting for a much smaller pie. 90% of miners will become unprofitable.	SatoshiLite	9	2	1527205286	999797552617697280	https://twitter.com/SatoshiLite/status/999797552617697280

	I really hope you're not just asking this question as an indirect way to shill for some other cryptocurrency.

	"If Alice has never used Lightning before, then she has to pay the on-chain fees to open at least a few channels.

	The response you'd get from Lightning proponents (I'm a fence sitter) would be that if Alice has any other payment channels already open which could be hopped across to reach Bob, those would facilitate the transaction without on-chain fees.	ummjackson	11	0	1527283044	1000123693866012674	https://twitter.com/ummjackson/status/1000123693866012674

	This is kind of misleading, as it's more akin to Shapeshift adding better Trezor support.

	I think the reality is that their actual costs are funded by the ICO projects paying for booths + speaking slots, then they give away the majority of the tickets for free privately to convince people to attend.	ummjackson	2	0	1527275044	1000090137911443457	https://twitter.com/ummjackson/status/1000090137911443457

	Actually, for everyday trust-minimized money for the non-filthy-rich, silver was an improvement over gold. Far more used for buying land, paying legal fines, etc. in the earliest written records than gold. (Second most common was copper, and for farmland transactions barley).

	No, that's about 99.9% of cultures with gold in their environment, but no exposure to cultures turning gold into artifacts, ignored gold. The first and early uses of gold were extremely non-obvious, entailing extremely high uncertainty.

bitcoin 	That physics is important because of the resulting secure supply curve, validation, storage, transport, etc. properties, not inherently. Bitcoin & its predecessor design bit gold were designed to improve those properties, and in most ways Bitcoin is a huge improvement over gold.

	Uncertainty was so high, indeed, that shell-using cultures almost always ignored gold dust & nuggets in their environment (e.g. indigenous cultures of California). Was highly improbable event when Danubians started supplementing shell beads with gold beads, and then kept at it.

	There was already over a millennium of experience with gold before it appeared in written records, so what those records say about it say is irrelevant to the uncertainty surrounding its use during its first few decades, which common sense tells us would have been quite high.

	Try zooming out on all markets, long charts are the only way to capture it. Log charts capture ROI properly on the vertical access. If you didn't 0.1 to 1, seems small next to 1 to 10.

	2/ The risk is there that $ BTC goes lower and drags down alts with it (some more than others) but just like beginning of last month with $ btc uncertainty high when looking for setups at Dec. lows, I like the r:r of the coins at April/cycle lows. relevant:https://twitter.com/VentureCoinist/status/997914912524505088 …	VentureCoinist	6	3	1527204990	999796310076215296	https://twitter.com/VentureCoinist/status/999796310076215296

	Financial markets, for instance, have already learned to dismiss much of what Trump says, on a daily basis, as so much noise.

	The success of a move like that depends heavily on your broader credibility. It’s not nearly as effective if it can reasonably be interpreted as part of a wider clown show.

	I will say this, in Trump’s possible favor.

	Oh, I don't mean to imply that they don't have their own agenda, or that it should take precedence over ours. But it is important to do all that we can to keep them on-side.

	Of course it does. It makes them look like peacemakers and undermines the sanctions regime.

	It’s like people who become obsessed with their “legacy”. It starts getting in the way of the humdrum and sometimes thankless task of actually buikding a meaningful legacy.	prchovanec	7	1	1527207497	999806827478048769	https://twitter.com/prchovanec/status/999806827478048769			
	Trump’s constant need to demonstrate (and be told) he is “playing Kim like a fiddle” is actually what makes him vulnerable to just that kind of manipulation. It is, in itself, a critical weakness.	prchovanec	7	3	1527207342	999806175028891648	https://twitter.com/prchovanec/status/999806175028891648			
	The goal here is not to get Kim to the summit table - he’s always wanted that - but to convince him to adopt a fundamentally different path for his regime and survival. This is going to take a lot more persistence and a lot less theater than Trump seems to think.	prchovanec	5	2	1527207019	999804821472448513	https://twitter.com/prchovanec/status/999804821472448513			
	The eagerness of Team Trump to declare their man a negotiating genius, no matter what happens, really blinds them to the games North Korea is playing, and has always played, to gain the upper hand. Less genius, more awareness would go a long way.	prchovanec	21	4	1527206844	999804087758737408	https://twitter.com/prchovanec/status/999804087758737408			
	This is a very silly take. Kim is trying to frame US as the recalcitrant party, himself as the willing peacemaker, in order to weaken the sanctions regime. I suspect DPRK still does want a summit (they always have), but they’re still jockeying for position.https://twitter.com/timrunshismouth/status/999797319187955713 …	prchovanec	66	23	1527206645	999803252593045504	https://twitter.com/prchovanec/status/999803252593045504

	If a summit happens, it will cement North Korea’s status as a nuclear power and a peer of the major powers. That’s why they want it. They know that denuclearization is not going to happen.

	Gold dropped 40% in 2008.. when SPX dropped 40% in fall 2008.... once again.. if you think Gold is protect for SPX you will go BROKE.... Gold rallied HUGE in 2009..

	gold is a play on the dollar... it hasn't got SH@T TO DO WITH SPX.... and no one serious believes that if the dollar drops.. SPX has to go down?!!??! do they.... so the SPX and gold talk both can't rally is the most WRONG VIEW EVER... they have NOTHING to do with each other	Bamabroker	12	0	1527205708	999799321137635328	https://twitter.com/Bamabroker/status/999799321137635328			@T
