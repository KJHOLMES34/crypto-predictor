	Tourist attractions are overrated. Instead, when going to a place, go for some specific reason (eg. conference), and forbid yourself from using subway/car to get around; instead walk, even if it's a 10km walk. It's both cheaper, and you get a more genuine experience that way.	VitalikButerin	5292	694	1527858835	1002538734661713920	https://twitter.com/VitalikButerin/status/1002538734661713920

	Being “contained” in a resort had a lot of benefits, IMO. Everybody was passing each other, regularly, in flip-flops, and the atmosphere was very chill and inclusive.

	Tone! I have dozens of friends who once made a living on YouTube but have now been demonetized (which is censorship).

	People call anyone on the news 'journalist.' I'm sure they call Rachel Maddow a 'journalist' as well. Or Bill O'Reilly or Sean Hannity. They are just givers of their opinions and shapers of narratives. Journalists no longer work on TV.

	I wouldn't call Joy Reid a journalist. She's paid to give her opinion on things.

	Well, the outraged mob doesn’t need to go trolling through posts of a bygone era. They can challenge her on her lies today.

	Yes, I’m referring to Joy Reid’s old comments. I think her batshit # russiagate conspiracy theories and her deranged claims of a blogging hacker are reason enough today to maybe not fire but perhaps take her opinion with a very large grain of salt.	stacyherbert	10	1	1527806892	1002320870172516352	https://twitter.com/stacyherbert/status/1002320870172516352		#

	The dirty secret of smart contracts is that they're of very limited usefulness and extremely hard to secure. More limitation is required here, not more ways to screw up. The hype and the engineering reality are extremely divergent.	jimmysong	172	22	1527861148	1002548436598652928	https://twitter.com/jimmysong/status/1002548436598652928			
	Second, it was MySpace that was far less secure and scalable. If anything ETH is the MySpace in this analogy. Third, smart contracts are one of those buzzwords that get a lot of play from people that don't know the engineering reality.	jimmysong	125	11	1527861065	1002548090073595905	https://twitter.com/jimmysong/status/1002548090073595905			
ethereum 	This is a grossly inept analogy. First, Ethereum's smart contract usage is extremely limited. Vast majority of the data on their network is ERC20 and ERC721 tokens, neither of which require Turing completeness.	jimmysong	147	13	1527860831	1002547106115145728	https://twitter.com/jimmysong/status/1002547106115145728			
ethereum 	"Bare multisig (OP_CHECKMULTISIG) has existed from the beginning, as were OP_IF, OP_AND and a whole host of other ""smart contract"" features. This myth that Ethereum somehow created smart contracts is a lie pure and simple."	jimmysong	147	36	1527852708	1002513037830623233	https://twitter.com/jimmysong/status/1002513037830623233			
bitcoin 	Please stop perpetuating this ridiculous lie, Bitcoin has had smart contracts from the beginning. It's called Script.	jimmysong	573	64	1527851123	1002506389766500352	https://twitter.com/jimmysong/status/1002506389766500352			
bitcoin 	I don't know how I missed this when it first came out, but an absolute gem. Why the top down design of so many an altcoin or ICO is inferior to the bottom up approach of Bitcoin.

	There were so many points of contact between Russia and the Trump campaign that it would have been pure dereliction for the FBI *not* to mount a counter-intelligence investigation.
