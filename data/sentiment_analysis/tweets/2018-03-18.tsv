	It's more like a pile of cash. If somebody else gets their hands on it, it's immediately spendable by the thief. The burden is on you to try and figure who took it and even if you're lucky enough to figure it out you then have to prove it was really yours. And the thief is broke.	haydentiff	9	0	1521376798	975351101661868032	https://twitter.com/haydentiff/status/975351101661868032

bitcoin 	When I transferred Bitcoin into Abra and exchanged it for $ XRP, I had no idea what I was actually holding or how to verify ownership. And there is something wrong with the private key. It can't be restored from the BIP39 mnemonic.

	B is more secure because the recipients of the 10 million dollars want to keep it that way. In fact, they'll spend up to 9 million dollars more to defend their award than in scenario A.	jimmysong	2	0	1521341142	975201551458406400	https://twitter.com/jimmysong/status/975201551458406400			
	What's k_s or k_x in this scenario? Since X = rS where r is the reward percentage, k_s can be expressed as k_x * r. They're the same equation so one can't be more accurate than the other.	jimmysong	1	0	1521341029	975201075782389763	https://twitter.com/jimmysong/status/975201075782389763			
	Not sure what scholastry is or what you're implying. If It costs 100 tokens to stake and you get 1 reward, they are proportional (100:1). You said attack is proportional to stake but not to reward. That doesn't make sense.	jimmysong	12	0	1521330784	975158106245287937	https://twitter.com/jimmysong/status/975158106245287937			
	Since reward is proportional to stake, if attack is proportional to stake then by transitivity of proportionality, reward is proportional to attack. Regardless, I'm not sure why you're being hostile. You're relying on a punishment mechanism not being subvertible.	jimmysong	6	0	1521328933	975150341397340160	https://twitter.com/jimmysong/status/975150341397340160

bitcoin 	"agreed. that isn't to say bitcoin is without challenges, but i find it odd to watch very intelligent people bemoan the ""wasteful"" nature of cryptocurrencies. the custodial costs of physical gold are tremendous as well."

	8/ in the current environment where hundreds of protocols are competing for attention, i'm eager to see what forces will train the market to think in new ways and to differentiate between absolute and relative value of projects	Melt_Dem	34	3	1521333366	975168935300562944	https://twitter.com/Melt_Dem/status/975168935300562944			
ethereum 	7/ ethereum is a perfect example of a project that understood these dynamics - design (solidity) informed community (javascript devs). marketing (world computer) informed use cases (smart contracts).

	6/ this is why i'm very bullish on companies and projects that focus on user experience, design, and training behavioral loops. good engineering is the basis of any project, but design and marketing differentiates a mediocre project from an absolutely phenomenal project.

	5/ i wonder how we can get better at helping ourselves and others identify and correct these flaws in our logic and reasoning. data and metrics are one tool - but i think much of it will be driven by user experience and design of the tools we use and the content we consume	Melt_Dem	24	3	1521333067	975167678796173312	https://twitter.com/Melt_Dem/status/975167678796173312

	3/ relative analysis is always more valuable than absolute analysis. i sometimes fall into this trap - especially in crypto - of thinking x is better than y without attempting to understand the relative value of x and its analogs	Melt_Dem	44	3	1521332790	975166517066203136	https://twitter.com/Melt_Dem/status/975166517066203136

	in the short term, marketing wins, that's definitely not new and not unique to crypto. in the long term, substance wins. the question is really just a matter of time scale, and what your goals are.

	Indeed, the best way to do this is exactly as you suggest: a technical innovation, concisely explained to experts, in the whitepaper, and an accompanying business plan, clearly described to non-technical investors, that builds on the technical innovation.	el33th4xor	10	2	1521396654	975434385397813249	https://twitter.com/el33th4xor/status/975434385397813249

	Nice. I do sense it. Yes. And it's bound to be thus in the self-correcting system that we now operate within. Getting to brink helps us evolve. But, that said, it doesn't happen by itself.

	Yes. I do. Definitely sensing a turning point in awareness. I'm even hopeful that Zuckerberg's regrets are genuine. But we have A LOT to undo. And the real barrier lies in the pressure that the social media titans' shareholders will bring to bear.

	The chance of that happening is ~25% ... ~15% chance we shoot past $28,000 by the end of 2018 (or 2019). More than likely (60%) we will be trapped between $10,000 and $20,000. We are a lot closer to $2,800 than we are to $28,000 so you are not exactly going out on a limb here.
