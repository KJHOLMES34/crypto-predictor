ripple 	Venture capitalists who invest in startups, like Ripple, for example, receive stock. If a Ripple investor wants to sell his stock right now, he has to do it on what's called a second market. Apparently, they are private markets.	haydentiff	3	0	1523823941	985615162743848966	https://twitter.com/haydentiff/status/985615162743848966
