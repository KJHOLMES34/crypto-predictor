	That is, @ slatestarcodex is right that coordinated deploring often works better, but because the zero-sum private signalling component to the incentive is in coordinated deploring's favor, the equilibrium pushes further in that direction than is optimal.

	I think one problem is that the *private incentive* is to deplore things that you know others also deplore, as that causes local bonding rather than discord, and so the free market in outrage gets stuck being hung up on particular issues more often than is socially optimal.

bitcoin 	This is the legacy of Mark Zuckerberg who got away with stealing the FB’s code he was paid to develop. Now every developer feels entitled to do same. # Bitcoin’s development is, according to some, slow.

	My point was that presenting claims that are necessary for a transaction to take place (eg, I am allowed to travel of the subway) are good, whereas identifying people as a proxy to get to the attributes is bad, generally speaking.	dgwbirch	1	0	1529661585	1010100016726315008	https://twitter.com/dgwbirch/status/1010100016726315008

	"It's not a silver bullet and ""a blockchain"" could mean a variety of things. Messaging standards are interpreted by organisations free to define their own logic.

	You'd think I'm not describing anything complex, but ISO20022, FIX and FMPL messaging hasn't cut it. Different systems record different messages in different ways. There's no way to know that what I see is what you see. If it wasn't that complex, it would work.

	Ok so we now have A UK exchange, a UK issuer of Mike coin, a US exchange, a US securities depository and potentially market makers for the FX. They all have their own custodians and CSD's.

	Because your Mike coin is issued by your central bank. But the banking system doesn't have one issuer of currency or assets. It has many. Therefore it can have no golden source by centralising	sytaylor	0	0	1529618600	1009919726393397248	https://twitter.com/sytaylor/status/1009919726393397248

	8/ Lastly, given the cost-benefit dynamics above, CFBLs will likely be the least price-sensitive buyers in the market and therefore will have a high success rate in acquisition attempts (CFBLs are likely willing to pay higher valuations than other potential buyers).

	7/ Also, organic growth is hard (“buy vs. build”): Building is particularly hard in an industry with a talent scarcity and a rapidly shifting competitive and regulatory landscape. This increased risk to building pushes the incentives toward “buy” (acquire).	CremeDeLaCrypto	8	1	1529629731	1009966409802080256	https://twitter.com/CremeDeLaCrypto/status/1009966409802080256			
	6/ The benefit is huge: acquisitions offer CFBLs a quick way to acquire manpower and revenue lines, and to drive community signaling	CremeDeLaCrypto	5	1	1529629698	1009966271989891077	https://twitter.com/CremeDeLaCrypto/status/1009966271989891077			
	5/ Acquisition cost is low for CFBLs: These entities sit on a large amt of cash (to fund acquisitions) and often have an inventory of tokens that could increase in value with announcement news (partially or fully offsetting the cost of the acquisition)	CremeDeLaCrypto	5	1	1529629681	1009966201269714945	https://twitter.com/CremeDeLaCrypto/status/1009966201269714945			
	4/ There’s several incentives at play that will drive this trend including a very favorable cost-benefit relationship and a competitive/regulatory landscape that favors “buy” over “build”. A closer look…	CremeDeLaCrypto	4	1	1529629655	1009966094314946560	https://twitter.com/CremeDeLaCrypto/status/1009966094314946560			
	3/ As token inventory of CFBLs diminishes, incentives suggest that these entities will leverage their cash positions to acquire companies in order to help fulfill their objectives of building a functioning network with community traction and real-world use-cases.

	2/ First, CFBLs are entities whose primary cash flow generation has been from the sale of an inventory of tokens.	CremeDeLaCrypto	4	2	1529629627	1009965976257847296	https://twitter.com/CremeDeLaCrypto/status/1009965976257847296
