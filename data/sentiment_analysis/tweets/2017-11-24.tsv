bitcoin 	that's all it *did* take.

	I think there was review on 91 code. It's also emboldening. Users dared and won, even if perceptually. Next time they will go all in - more determined. People know that game theory so they even less dare fight users, hodlers and investors. Makes no sense for miners to go against.	adam3us	1	0	1511534625	934070038394413056	https://twitter.com/adam3us/status/934070038394413056			
	"So in my view ""wish we'd seen a test of UASF w/o Core support or business support"" was met. And is a useful precedent and balance showing users and hodlers/investors have strong influence.

	Well most of R & D community, majority I think, was not keen about 148 UASF for rushed time-frame risk reasons. U=User was grass roots. Various claims, but fact is big influence for 91 signal was UASF risk avoidance on 1 Aug, to avoid miner 148 fork. 91 code was not in core repo.	adam3us	12	0	1511532629	934061666181849088	https://twitter.com/adam3us/status/934061666181849088			
	And FWIW everyone of them would say users, investors, hodlers should do their own research, hire their own independent reviewers and decide for themselves what to run independently. And stand ready to fork the code if they are kidnapped or lose the pulse of the community.	adam3us	3	2	1511529066	934046721730002945	https://twitter.com/adam3us/status/934046721730002945

	Maybe in Jihan's plan (many told B2X organisers they were being played) but clearly many ex-B2X supporters don't like BCH. They wanted an upgrade not a spin-off. That's why they called B2X off when it become clear to them it would be a 3rd spinoff.	adam3us	8	1	1511516838	933995433181044736	https://twitter.com/adam3us/status/933995433181044736
