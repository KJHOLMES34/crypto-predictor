bitcoin 	This may not last forever either, if Bitcoin ever became a stable global measure of wealth, the “recoupling” also may occur.

	The “decoupling” happens when crypto assets are valued on their intrinsic value, against a more stable measure, not against the fluctuating relative value of BTC.

	Yes, that's why 0-conf is unreliable. You can do stuff to mitigate it, but you have to be smart about it. There's no way to make 0-conf have the same assurance as confirmations.

	That's worse. That will encourage double spends. Just send a payment to a merchant. Merchant gives you the merchandise with 0-conf.

	Nodes will throwaway the 2nd conflicting transaction. So you just send 2 transactions out at the same time to opposite sides of the world. You likely won't get a 50/50 split.

	They are, but they throw away the 2nd conflicting transaction. So if you send 2 transactions out at the same time (1 to a chinese pool and 1 to an american pool), half the network would think the other transaction is the double spend.

	A simple attack would be to broadcast a double spend and send each transaction to half the network. If the double spend gets mined, then 50% of the network would orphan. You now just cut the networks total hashpower in half. Keep doing that to disrupt the whole network.

	So maybe my entire idea of pricing in fiat terms (including an SDR pegged # stablecoin), just represents an interim solution (next years/decades, not centuries)	cburniske	9	0	1522366017	979500187461697536	https://twitter.com/cburniske/status/979500187461697536		#	
	All of that said, fiat terms will become meaningless if we can someday price everything in a stable-ish # cryptoasset, which could plausibly be tied to its own intrinsically generated value.	cburniske	7	2	1522365826	979499384797913088	https://twitter.com/cburniske/status/979499384797913088		#	
	My bet is on a SDR-pegged # stablecoin: http://www.imf.org/en/About/Factsheets/Sheets/2016/08/01/14/51/Special-Drawing-Right-SDR … Lots of people are pretty sick of the dollar.	cburniske	13	3	1522365482	979497942494187520	https://twitter.com/cburniske/status/979497942494187520		#	
	It is really the *uncertainty* around future price that induces a mental tax on spending a # cryptoasset, presenting a bull case for a successful stablecoin as a psychologically simple unit of account.	cburniske	20	5	1522365299	979497175003607040	https://twitter.com/cburniske/status/979497175003607040		#

	Hypothesis: we will need to stop thinking about paying for crypto services, in *crypto terms.* Better to think about the services, and perhaps to present the services, in *dollar terms.* Why?

	Working on update.. and yes I know fundamentals don't drives stocks... but one comment..

	Keep in mind.. down the road I think inflation is the issue and CBs will then have to take MASSIVE amounts of liquidity out.. but that is NOT NOW... so for now... we could be about to see crypto bottom..

	3rd.. yield curve is WAY WAY too flat... 2-10 spread now 50 bips.... even heard today 2 FED members say we can't hike unless yield curve improves... meaning markets may see ASAP..
