	The main challenge is determining what authority you *do* give the government, and how.

	Our perspective is that the risk of an HF is roughly proportional to its complexity, not constant.

	But this latest rally is more extreme than others, so risk is for even bigger correction. I see crypto's passage through time being built on a series of speculative bubbles that ultimately override each other.

	Good point. The chart only works for bubbles - which can only be identified after the fact -- not for exponential increases that don't collapse. It pre-judges BTC as a bubble. It illustrates the territory we're in. But that's all.

bitcoin 	I think this is valid as a token’s value is a function of network utility. What if there were an electricity token?

	If you read my article, you'll see it's not what I'm saying. I'm a long-term bull.

	Interesting. The http://Blockchain.info  trading volume estimates differ from Coinmarketcap's, perhaps because the former uses only USD (or fiat?) pairs. Still, either set of numbers shows the market is highly liquid, comparable to large cap public tech stocks.

bitcoin 	Coinmarketcap doesn't yet have historical graphs for trading volume, but usually they report Bitcoin's 24H volume to be 1-3B. As an example, here are two randomly selected days: http://web.archive.org/web/20171102021023/https://coinmarketcap.com/ … http://web.archive.org/web/20170908153915/https://coinmarketcap.com/ … Full archive here: http://web.archive.org/web/*/coinmarketcap.com …	balajis	6	0	1511930330	935729742153703430	https://twitter.com/balajis/status/935729742153703430			
	Ha :) One other interesting aspect of this rise, though -- public blockchains are the world's first decentralized decacorns. So the early adopters are spread out worldwide rather than concentrated totally in SV. Means less upward pressure on real estate.	balajis	11	1	1511926982	935715700320092161	https://twitter.com/balajis/status/935715700320092161			
ethereum 	Well, then we're already in crypto 4.0 :) There have been at least three major crashes/weedouts in late 2011, mid 2013, and 2014-2015 respectively in BTC alone. Ethereum has also had at least 3 crashes (pre-launch due to BTC crash, late 2015 drop, and mid 2016 after the DAO).	balajis	9	0	1511924950	935707176437391360	https://twitter.com/balajis/status/935707176437391360			
	Here's my math. Let me know if off base, or else if you'd agree this is a highly liquid market. 1) BTC 24h trading volume = $6,801,010,000 2) FB 24h trading volume = 13,694,064 x $183 = $2.5Bpic.twitter.com/rQSRIaeESK	balajis	45	14	1511924617	935705780795326464	https://twitter.com/balajis/status/935705780795326464			
	Ah, but people are already highly liquid! For example, BTC's trading volume over the last 24 hours was $6.8B while FB's was $2.5B. That's not a one-time thing either; crypto is already as liquid as the largest public tech stocks. http://www.nasdaq.com/symbol/fb https://coinmarketcap.com/	balajis	44	5	1511924355	935704680834854913	https://twitter.com/balajis/status/935704680834854913			
bitcoin ethereum 	By contrast, I would put internecine disputes in a different category. Folks who were pro-Bitcoin but anti-Ethereum (or vice versa, or pro-another coin) didn't completely miss the boat. It's only the vitriolic blockchain skeptics who played themselves and ended up with zero.	balajis	14	0	1511923636	935701667143487488	https://twitter.com/balajis/status/935701667143487488			
	To be clear, in this context at least I'm referring to those who took a negative attitude towards *all* things blockchain.

	But having consistent follow through and application of the rules and laws is largely absent. Everyone knows ways around the system.

	There are so many rules and laws for everything in China that you can always run afoul. Consequently, the real rules are implicit in the functioning of society.

	One belief I hold very strongly after living in China is that if a law exists, you enforce it or you get it off the books. You do not choose to enforce a law based upon who the boss is.

	Problem with Chinese regulation execution is not in citing the problem. The problem is in the resolution. We see one of two problems.
