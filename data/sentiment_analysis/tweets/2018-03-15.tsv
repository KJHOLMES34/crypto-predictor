	"So basically, the main difference between people who finish college and people who drop out 2/3 of the way through is some kind of ""ability"", and both the ability itself and the signal of the ability contribute to the sheepskin effect. Makes sense; need to think more."	VitalikButerin	5	3	1521136074	974341432331964417	https://twitter.com/VitalikButerin/status/974341432331964417			
	OK, then I was thinking of 60%, the size of the sheepskin effect, which as seen from Bryan's arguments seems more likely to be a result of signalling specifically the kinds of traits that lead to you finishing degrees, rather than raw intelligence or similar things.	VitalikButerin	3	3	1521124750	974293935630815232	https://twitter.com/VitalikButerin/status/974293935630815232			
	That signaling in general is very important is believable. But that signaling conformism, determination, perseverance and similar traits is 4x more important than signaling and presence of intelligence and abilities created by education is a tougher stretch.	VitalikButerin	4	3	1521124138	974291371124195328	https://twitter.com/VitalikButerin/status/974291371124195328			
	Or just start with something like https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herfindahl_index …	VitalikButerin	5	3	1521107892	974223226430779393	https://twitter.com/VitalikButerin/status/974223226430779393			
	But the idea that 80% of the returns to college come specifically from signaling conformism and dedication also seems very far-fetched to me, at least for now, and yet statistics argue against all other explanations I can think of. So at present I am veeeeerrrry confused....	VitalikButerin	7	4	1521107480	974221499816169474	https://twitter.com/VitalikButerin/status/974221499816169474			
	My own experience does agree with this assessment FYI. I feel like I benefited immensely from my first year of uni (Bryan would say even there I'm an unusual case, and I agree) but my friends who stayed longer all report finding subsequent years much less useful and interesting.

	BTW, as a small business that collects revenue for subscriptions, I do more 'banking' with PayPal than I do with my bank. 90% of my customers use my PayPal account to pay and I use it for purchases. Single click transactions. They manage risk, simplify my life, and build loyalty.	JimMarous	3	0	1521127152	974304010944606208	https://twitter.com/JimMarous/status/974304010944606208			
	I have a life where money transfer is in the background. I won't ever have an emotional relationship with my bank (except anger and frustration). I do have a relationship with Amazon.

	Banks can’t compete with the option of free Amazon Prime or discounts on Amazon products. Amazon has margin to add the mix. Banks don’t.

bitcoin 	That is the safest bet I have ever made. What you dont understand is thst fluctuations within a few months gmhave zero impact on long term growth.

	We must air it out: This hatred on miners and their centralisation. Mining is a business. Businesses centralize and one will own the space. Always. Jihan won.
