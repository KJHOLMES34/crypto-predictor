	It's an open field at this point. Token-to-Market fit still needs to proven as a hypothesis, just like product/market fit for startups.	wmougayar	1	1	1508692192	922148009902669824	https://twitter.com/wmougayar/status/922148009902669824			
	The purity of the mix ranges, true. Not all tokens are going to be worth their salt. But some will. I don't want to pre-judge yet.	wmougayar	2	1	1508684436	922115478176202753	https://twitter.com/wmougayar/status/922115478176202753			
	Selling & $ not the right metrics w protocols & infrastructure. Can't extrapolate. It is risky yes, but some good will come out.	wmougayar	2	2	1508684300	922114907675410433	https://twitter.com/wmougayar/status/922114907675410433			
ethereum 	Crypto funding has already proven it otherwise. Eg Ethereum and a dozen others are a clear success already.	wmougayar	3	3	1508684190	922114444674482176	https://twitter.com/wmougayar/status/922114444674482176			
	But now w higher stakes, more money, bolder moves.	wmougayar	0	1	1508684122	922114159369531392	https://twitter.com/wmougayar/status/922114159369531392			
	They have different models eg protocols which aren't like traditional businesses, but more like a different kind of startup.	wmougayar	1	1	1508683936	922113382068584450	https://twitter.com/wmougayar/status/922113382068584450			
	Yup. Nothing has changed there.	wmougayar	1	1	1508683744	922112576779042816	https://twitter.com/wmougayar/status/922112576779042816			
	"We still need a stronger foundation based on proven models before extending it to ""everything'."	wmougayar	2	1	1508677123	922084804081913856	https://twitter.com/wmougayar/status/922084804081913856			
	But you can lose 100% of your money in lotto, just as some will in crypto. Just saying the range from losses to gains is very wide.	wmougayar	0	1	1508675233	922076878554456064	https://twitter.com/wmougayar/status/922076878554456064			
	Or like a long term lotto. You buy a ticket once, then wait.	wmougayar	0	1	1508674596	922074204161347585	https://twitter.com/wmougayar/status/922074204161347585			
	2/2 Corollary: Funding is lifeblood of startups. Law of numbers. More successes will follow from ICO route than VC method in crypto segment.	wmougayar	27	11	1508674491	922073764006973440	https://twitter.com/wmougayar/status/922073764006973440			
	1/2 Corollary: Without ICOs, maybe 30-40 Crypto startups would have received VC funding in past 12 months. With ICOs, 300-400 are funded.	wmougayar	46	14	1508674486	922073743949815809	https://twitter.com/wmougayar/status/922073743949815809			
	But also, more successes will emerge. Law of numbers.	wmougayar	0	1	1508674073	922072010825588736	https://twitter.com/wmougayar/status/922072010825588736			
	Yup. All risks are raised.	wmougayar	1	1	1508673891	922071246665285632	https://twitter.com/wmougayar/status/922071246665285632			
ethereum 	It depends. Each case is different. VCs didn't invest in Ethereum.	wmougayar	3	1	1508673862	922071126804783104	https://twitter.com/wmougayar/status/922071126804783104			
	One way to think of ICOs: they give a chance to entrepreneurs who won't/can't raise from VCs. It lowers entry bar, but raises success risks.	wmougayar	96	34	1508672942	922067269013966848	https://twitter.com/wmougayar/status/922067269013966848
