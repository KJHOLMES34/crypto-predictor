	If the size and cost is 3x I wonder if people would use CT widely. I think it could be interesting to increase the blocksize alongside because CT improves fungibilty to offset the centralisation risk. Best yet for fungibilty would be CT always on.	adam3us	66	9	1510655909	930384434477481984	https://twitter.com/adam3us/status/930384434477481984
