	Fought for UASF and dispelled FUD on Twitter. It takes all of us to stand up and make cryptocurrency antifragile.	SatoshiLite	31	2	1526840409	998267145849991169	https://twitter.com/SatoshiLite/status/998267145849991169			
	Haha, but it didn't matter in the end. It did put me in a weird position though. I was happy that Segwit2x was cancelled but I lost millions because of it. Lol	SatoshiLite	11	1	1526840335	998266837967060992	https://twitter.com/SatoshiLite/status/998266837967060992			
bitcoin 	Oh yeah, and let's not forget the 250BTC bet I had with Roger against Segwit2x. I've done more for Bitcoin than most people. So quite tired of getting attacked by Bitcoin maximalists. You and others have done a lot also, but we are in the same boat.	SatoshiLite	86	3	1526840194	998266245622284288	https://twitter.com/SatoshiLite/status/998266245622284288			
bitcoin 	I think I've had enough of this conversation. I've put $1MM on the line of my own personal money for the sole purpose of helping Bitcoin activate SegWit. I don't need to take shit from people about it.	SatoshiLite	105	10	1526839884	998264944347889664	https://twitter.com/SatoshiLite/status/998264944347889664			
	I did it for the exact reason I stated. It was a conflict of interest in my mind. I didn't want financial incentives to cause me to act not for the long term interest of the coin. Also to remove some centralization around myself. It's hard for people to understand. Oh well.	SatoshiLite	9	0	1526839715	998264237888716800	https://twitter.com/SatoshiLite/status/998264237888716800

	In hindsight, I would have. I created for fun and didn't expect it to become so successful. I didnt have the hindsight of Satoshi.	SatoshiLite	10	0	1526838290	998258260099518465	https://twitter.com/SatoshiLite/status/998258260099518465			
bitcoin 	If one miner/pool didn't, another would have. And there was no guarantee that Bitcoin would get SegWit. Game theory would make it such that some miner/pool would steal the $1MM if they could.	SatoshiLite	3	0	1526838229	998258005664649216	https://twitter.com/SatoshiLite/status/998258005664649216			
bitcoin litecoin 	Which ones? Tell me one that had a high enough marketcap with enough liquidity that could handle $1MM. Litecoin also had the closest mining ecosystem to Bitcoin.	SatoshiLite	24	0	1526838080	998257377777401856	https://twitter.com/SatoshiLite/status/998257377777401856			
bitcoin litecoin 	I can't say for others, but I created Litecoin not to get rich quick. I would just be as well off today had I not created Litecoin. I created more for fun and because I think Litecoin can complement Bitcoin. And also found out later that Litecoin can help Bitcoin out with SegWit.	SatoshiLite	26	5	1526837965	998256897030479872	https://twitter.com/SatoshiLite/status/998256897030479872			
litecoin 	Did you forget the anyone-can-spend FUD? If there was a way for miners to steal from SegWit, they wouldn't reveal it on testnet. But having $1MM sitting there on Litecoin SegWit address for months shows that miners can't just steal that money.	SatoshiLite	48	0	1526837470	998254821894340608	https://twitter.com/SatoshiLite/status/998254821894340608			
litecoin 	And Litecoin is comparable. Less censorship-resistance for less cost. Comparable to less reliable for more efficient packets and faster communication.	SatoshiLite	4	1	1526837334	998254250168733696	https://twitter.com/SatoshiLite/status/998254250168733696			
bitcoin litecoin 	I would also argue that Litecoin and others improve the censorship-resistance of cryptocurrency in general. If there was only Bitcoin, it becomes very easy for governments to take it down. But knowing that there will be others to take over makes cryptocurrency antifragile.	SatoshiLite	91	10	1526837032	998252982352265216	https://twitter.com/SatoshiLite/status/998252982352265216			
bitcoin litecoin 	I would argue that Litecoin helped Bitcoin get SegWit faster by dispelling the SegWit FUD. It has not slowed down the adoption of Bitcoin.	SatoshiLite	56	6	1526836332	998250046607912960	https://twitter.com/SatoshiLite/status/998250046607912960			
	Not for a TCP/IP-maximalist!	SatoshiLite	1	0	1526835681	998247317269430274	https://twitter.com/SatoshiLite/status/998247317269430274			
	You think so? In what sense? That they will all go to 0 and more people will get hurt?	SatoshiLite	10	0	1526835351	998245931047776256	https://twitter.com/SatoshiLite/status/998245931047776256			
	True	SatoshiLite	5	0	1526800344	998099102884814848	https://twitter.com/SatoshiLite/status/998099102884814848			
bitcoin litecoin 	I've always said that Litecoin complements Bitcoin and doesn't replace it.	SatoshiLite	13	1	1526795508	998078816969940992	https://twitter.com/SatoshiLite/status/998078816969940992			
	When I sold my LTC last December, the LTC/BTC price was around 0.018, barely higher than today. Because it has underperformed BTC in the past 6 months and the past 5 years means that it's a scam? You are really something.	SatoshiLite	102	3	1526795458	998078608911433733	https://twitter.com/SatoshiLite/status/998078608911433733			
	So because BTC is superior to LTC, LTC is a scam. What kind of idiotic logic is that?	SatoshiLite	103	5	1526795234	998077670926663681	https://twitter.com/SatoshiLite/status/998077670926663681			
litecoin 	It's hard for people who's not in my shoes to understand. Given that I created Litecoin, my skin in the game is more about pride, respect, and accomplishment than financial. It's something money can't buy, so it's much more than just having money in the game.	SatoshiLite	65	5	1526787950	998047119083618305	https://twitter.com/SatoshiLite/status/998047119083618305			
	Sure, I have been doing that the past 6 months.	SatoshiLite	13	2	1526782609	998024717616349184	https://twitter.com/SatoshiLite/status/998024717616349184			
	Most of my LTC were bought with BTC. (Mined a few) So either it out performed BTC and made me money or it didn't and I should have held BTC instead, which would have made me more money. Pick one narrative. You don't get to make both claims in one tweet.	SatoshiLite	139	7	1526779378	998011163672690688	https://twitter.com/SatoshiLite/status/998011163672690688			
	Nothing I say will convince you as you don't believe there was a point. So I won't try.	SatoshiLite	10	0	1526778932	998009293545734145	https://twitter.com/SatoshiLite/status/998009293545734145			
litecoin 	No, altcoins aren't pointless and I didn't create Litecoin to make money.	SatoshiLite	16	1	1526774344	997990049751879682	https://twitter.com/SatoshiLite/status/997990049751879682			
bitcoin 	To take a page from Roger's book, I was a millionaire before Bitcoin. And I've held much more in BTC than LTC and have been public about that since the beginning.	SatoshiLite	98	0	1526771473	997978007875670016	https://twitter.com/SatoshiLite/status/997978007875670016			
bitcoin litecoin 	Some people think Litecoin played a huge role. Some think it was a small thing that helped a bit. To say that Litecoin played no role and that testnet was enough means that you don't understand UASF and game theory. Hard to believe that for someone who wrote a book on Bitcoin.	SatoshiLite	127	6	1526768377	997965022604148736	https://twitter.com/SatoshiLite/status/997965022604148736			
litecoin 	You're wrong. Testnet coins don't have value, so there weren't incentives to attack it. When Litecoin had SegWit with $1MM bounty on a SegWit address with no one able to steal those anyone-can-spend coins, that showed that it was all FUD. Sad that you didn't see that.

	Somebody commented once that they had a lot of racist friends. I thought “interesting, i don’t have any” followed by “maybe i do & just don’t know it because nobody would dare act that way in my presence” which lead me to wonder about the character of the person who commented.	haydentiff	4	0	1526847217	998295700285816832	https://twitter.com/haydentiff/status/998295700285816832			
	I think they do it more to deter other women. If the BCH community looks like a welcoming place for women, more will join. Like attracts like. Similarly, finding a way to make it look like a traumatizing experience is a very successful repellent. Just my 2 cents.	haydentiff	10	1	1526845368	998287947492478982	https://twitter.com/haydentiff/status/998287947492478982

	Overall, enterprise software is absolutely terrible. The glimmer of hope is that startup culture leads to a different, cleaner, simpler, more orthogonal system interface aesthetic. It's like Unix to the Multics aesthetic that pervades klunky enterprises today.	el33th4xor	31	1	1526831230	998228647126462465	https://twitter.com/el33th4xor/status/998228647126462465			
	"Worse, integration means that there are no compartments -- I can't give my password to someone, because they would be able to redirect my retirement funds.

	Now you bring in some software built in India to a spec written by some middle manager, and there are rigid rules. Admins cannot do anything at all, there is no concept of delegation.	el33th4xor	4	0	1526830846	998227036522078213	https://twitter.com/el33th4xor/status/998227036522078213			
	"Think about the complex delegation structure in any healthy organization. Someone may be authorized to make decisions far beyond their ""pay grade.""

	We had someone who had invented a delegation logic laboriously tutor the IT folks on delegation, but there are no results yet.

	Of course, admins love this, as the bad IT infrastructure enables them to push tasks onto their constituents. For more than half a decade, we couldn't get any changes enacted to IT infra, the requests got buried up the chain. The situation hasn't actually materially improved.	el33th4xor	6	0	1526826156	998207365869658112	https://twitter.com/el33th4xor/status/998207365869658112			
	The key problem is that most enterprise software fails to support delegation, so tasks that were previously done by admin assistants can no longer, because admins aren't on the right access control lists.	el33th4xor	7	2	1526825974	998206601411559424	https://twitter.com/el33th4xor/status/998206601411559424

Dharma rules all: how do I *do* my duty is pretty much all there is. Large amounts of free will totally break these axiomatic structures.	leashless	16	3	1526816925	998168650199846912	https://twitter.com/leashless/status/998168650199846912			
	"Specifically, the issues around choice and free will - so *fundamental* to the western mindset - sit very poorly with traditions which largely occurred inside of extremely rigid social constructs. ""How do I do this well?"" vs. ""What should I do with my life?"" are different minds!"	leashless	16	3	1526816764	998167972840648704	https://twitter.com/leashless/status/998167972840648704			
	I continue to learn about the differences between the ancient Hindu world model, and the lived experience of modern westerners.

	"""wasteful"" implies that we can get the same benefits without the same energy consumption. It may be wasteful to you, but it's not to many. To me, Christmas lights are wasteful."	CremeDeLaCrypto	5	0	1526843516	998280179205066752	https://twitter.com/CremeDeLaCrypto/status/998280179205066752			
bitcoin 	Fin/ Ultimately, highly decentralized networks like Bitcoin offer a fertile foundation for economic growth in the digital world and will likely be important underpinnings of our increasingly digital economy.	CremeDeLaCrypto	48	10	1526841641	998272313052164096	https://twitter.com/CremeDeLaCrypto/status/998272313052164096			
bitcoin 	10/ In this way, the Bitcoin network is a decentralized institution that defines, monitors, and enforces property rights. It is a reliable foundation of strong assurances on top of which we can efficiently architect arbitrary degrees of complexity.	CremeDeLaCrypto	32	1	1526841624	998272245054164994	https://twitter.com/CremeDeLaCrypto/status/998272245054164994			
bitcoin 	9/ The Bitcoin network, for example, offers a self-contained, reliable foundation for property rights in a digital world. It is a rules-based, self-arbitrating court where valid transactions are clearly defined, objectively verifiable, and unerringly enforced.	CremeDeLaCrypto	84	23	1526841614	998272202246995968	https://twitter.com/CremeDeLaCrypto/status/998272202246995968			
	8/ As we move to a world where people increasingly build in the cloud, economic activity will migrate to a digital equivalent: an accessible digital foundation that offers strong assurances and consistently enforces clearly defined (digital) property rights.	CremeDeLaCrypto	15	1	1526841604	998272159523880960	https://twitter.com/CremeDeLaCrypto/status/998272159523880960			
	7/ Why? well-enforced property rights provide incentives for individuals to participate in economic activities, such as investment, innovation and trade, which lead to a more efficient market.	CremeDeLaCrypto	17	1	1526841587	998272089458065408	https://twitter.com/CremeDeLaCrypto/status/998272089458065408			
	6/ This is important because property rights are a foundational component of economic growth and a primary explanatory variable for understanding differences in growth outcomes between jurisdiction.	CremeDeLaCrypto	17	1	1526841577	998272047166832640	https://twitter.com/CremeDeLaCrypto/status/998272047166832640			
	5/ Strong assurances essentially define the rules of economic engagement including, perhaps most importantly, property rights.	CremeDeLaCrypto	14	0	1526841561	998271980796166145	https://twitter.com/CremeDeLaCrypto/status/998271980796166145			
	4/ Indeed, a profound implication of some highly decentralized networks is the opportunity, at scale, to deliver stronger assurances than even the largest nation-states today—and in doing so to offer a robust, digital foundation for economic growth.	CremeDeLaCrypto	12	1	1526841550	998271932108697600	https://twitter.com/CremeDeLaCrypto/status/998271932108697600			
	3/ However, the Magna Carta was top-down: Kings relinquishing some privileges and extending rights to others. Interestingly, highly decentralized networks are constructing these rights in reverse—starting from the ground up with the “every-man”.	CremeDeLaCrypto	22	1	1526841538	998271881806413824	https://twitter.com/CremeDeLaCrypto/status/998271881806413824			
bitcoin 	2/ Symbolically, the Magna Carta marked a long-standing movement toward broad-based rule-of-law, and people’s rights. Now, highly decentralized networks like Bitcoin are picking up where our political institutions left off.	CremeDeLaCrypto	22	1	1526841525	998271826185764865	https://twitter.com/CremeDeLaCrypto/status/998271826185764865

	That assumes we are actually worse off if we choose free trade and they choose mercantilism, vs both choosing mercantilism. Which I'd argue is not the case.
