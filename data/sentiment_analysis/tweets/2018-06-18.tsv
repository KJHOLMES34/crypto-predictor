	What should one do: 1. Don't store coins and money on exchanges long term. 2. Ask that development teams provide careful post mortems after bugs, describing not only the patch to fix them, but the changes made to address whatever gave rise to the bug in the first place.	el33th4xor	77	11	1529328412	1008702587170893825	https://twitter.com/el33th4xor/status/1008702587170893825			
	The exchange can lose money due to one vulnerability, and then choose to socialize its losses, as was the case at Bitfinex. Bfx lost BTC, and people holding ETH on bfx ended up taking a haircut.	el33th4xor	21	2	1529328238	1008701860239245312	https://twitter.com/el33th4xor/status/1008701860239245312			
	Perhaps the safety criteria is sufficiently simple in EOS that my exchange hack prediction will not come to pass. Or maybe it will take the h4x0rs more than a year to master the vulnerabilities. Regardless, code dev culture trumps all else.	el33th4xor	32	3	1529327706	1008699628496277504	https://twitter.com/el33th4xor/status/1008699628496277504			
	The actual problems I was initially sure we would see in EOS involved liveness. We already had one of those issues within a day, fixed with a patch but without an analysis. We will also see more liveness issues.	el33th4xor	28	3	1529327706	1008699625283440640	https://twitter.com/el33th4xor/status/1008699625283440640			
	In the same vein, you can't start out with some bricks, beams and cables over a body of water, patch the holes where cars fall into the ocean, and end up with a load-bearing bridge.	el33th4xor	48	9	1529327705	1008699623081377792	https://twitter.com/el33th4xor/status/1008699623081377792			
	You can't incrementally patch your way to correctness. Testnets help find bugs but lack of bugs in testnet doesn't provide any assurance of correctness.	el33th4xor	42	5	1529327705	1008699620879425536	https://twitter.com/el33th4xor/status/1008699620879425536			
	Others have identified the lack of a testnet. Testnets are nice in that they can help identify problems, if you're lucky and they expose themselves in test. But the real subtle vulnerabilities arise only when a hacker prompts them. That won't happen in testnet.	el33th4xor	29	1	1529327704	1008699619524726784	https://twitter.com/el33th4xor/status/1008699619524726784			
	Absent is any discussion of correctness invariants. Instead, we see patches that mutate the code to fix identified problems, one patch at a time. Consensus protocols are too complex to get right this way.	el33th4xor	49	6	1529327704	1008699617545015298	https://twitter.com/el33th4xor/status/1008699617545015298			
	I base this prediction not on any specific vulnerability I suspect is in EOS code (see here http://hackingdistributed.com/2018/05/30/choose-your-own-security-disclosure-adventure/ … ), but on having read the project git and seen how they handle safety critical bugs.	el33th4xor	39	8	1529327703	1008699615800119296	https://twitter.com/el33th4xor/status/1008699615800119296			
	Exchanges have not yet figured out that EOS's governance model does not mix well with other currencies. EOS folks will blame others, and they won't be entirely wrong.	el33th4xor	41	6	1529327703	1008699614109880320	https://twitter.com/el33th4xor/status/1008699614109880320			
	If EOS uses its arbitrators to reverse the hack, the contagion will spread downstream. There will be threats of lawsuits involving the devs and the BPs. Twitter lawyers will point out the absurdity of the EOS constitution, or any document not grounded in actual law.	el33th4xor	54	5	1529327702	1008699612285276161	https://twitter.com/el33th4xor/status/1008699612285276161			
	I'm calling it: there will be a massive exchange hack within the next year, taking advantage of an EOS vulnerability. That exchange will lose its hot wallet. Hackers will send the proceeds to downstream exchanges, where they will trade into other coins.

	They acquired 3.3 million customers for just over £500 per customer.

ethereum 	I would agree but only insofar as we must assume that scaling solutions will never come to Ethereum. In an age of rapid innovation, its folly to predict a technology's future possibilities based on its current capabilities.

	Certainly true of the moment but at some time, app development will matter for measuring the total value around a blockchain protocol. How many devs working on websites vs on TCP/IP?

	As for benefits of a TRULY censorship-resistant currency, here's a bit one: Depoliticized money. Monetary policy by fiat inevitably = corporate capture of policymaking. Even the most pure CBer has to admit that QE etc. is shaped by business interests. (Not users).	mikejcasey	1	0	1529285109	1008520964437667840	https://twitter.com/mikejcasey/status/1008520964437667840			
bitcoin 	"If a currency's controlled by the ""rich and powerful (and criminals)"" it isn't censorship-resistant. Is bitcoin (vs. bitcoin cash, for example) of that quality? Yet to be decided. But censorship resistance in currencies is valuable, esp. outside of western democracies... 1/2"	mikejcasey	2	0	1529284723	1008519342798098432	https://twitter.com/mikejcasey/status/1008519342798098432

	. @ StephenMillerAL IS Iago. I read this profile hrs B4 seeing Shakespeare in the Park's great version of Othello.

bitcoin 	Bitcoin doesn't now have the numbers. So instead,solve the other giant flaw: per Satoshi, the trusted 3rd parties (the banks.) That problem, CBDC can and should address. Then, the competition begins. Eventually, can CBs compete with crypto? You suggest not. I tend to agree. 2/2	mikejcasey	2	1	1529280159	1008500202209202177	https://twitter.com/mikejcasey/status/1008500202209202177			
	Basically, I think the move toward censorship-resistant, fully decentralized money has to be evolutionary, not revolutionary. Not because cryptocurrencies aren't a superior model, but because the adoption curve is way to steep for most people. Money needs numbers to work. 1/2	mikejcasey	3	3	1529279865	1008498967318028288	https://twitter.com/mikejcasey/status/1008498967318028288

ethereum 	Hey I’m not criticizing the tech at all. My point was that EOS is forgoing immutability and creating a bad precedent like ethereum did during the DAO hack. What happens when a state wants to censor a tx? I thought the point of Blockchains is that so *no one* could have the power.

	One important reason I don’t listen to Dems who tell me to leave the Republican Party is that they were telling me the same thing 30 years ago.

	So much BS in the family separation debate. A family enters the US illegally? Fine. Deport. Together. But this policy is *meant* to produce photos of terrified children. It’s the goal: to traumatize kids in public as a deterrent. It’s immoral. If you support it, so are you.
