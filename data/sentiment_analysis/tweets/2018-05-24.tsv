	All a non-staking node can do in *any* system is verify stuff. In a non-sharded system, you can verify everything proactively. In a sharded system, it's more reactive: verify stuff you care about, and also verify in response to other nodes expressing concern about some data	VitalikButerin	9	2	1527183302	999705344191352832	https://twitter.com/VitalikButerin/status/999705344191352832

	Just the nodes that stake. This is linear, but with a very small constant factor; eg. if a node's validation code takes up ~250 bytes, and there's 1 million stakers, that's a 250 MB storage requirement.

	Very importantly, you don't get to choose what shard you're assigned to. (You can always choose to voluntarily client-side-validate shards that you're not assigned to if you're interested in them, but that's validating (reading), not block producing/confirming (writing))	VitalikButerin	4	2	1527180069	999691784966959104	https://twitter.com/VitalikButerin/status/999691784966959104

	Best to think in terms of who validates what. There are N shards, each shard has N transactions per block, total N^2 activity. Each node validates (i) all shard headers (N load), (ii) txs on the shard they are currently assigned to (N load).

bitcoin 	So Vergecoin follows the whitepaper closer than Bitcoin. It's Satoshi's vision!	SatoshiLite	64	23	1527195820	999757849772277760	https://twitter.com/SatoshiLite/status/999757849772277760

bitcoin 	I think the Bitcoin whitepaper only talks about longest chain but the implementation has always been largest accumulated difficulty.	SatoshiLite	12	1	1527195522	999756600771399681	https://twitter.com/SatoshiLite/status/999756600771399681

	Don't change something that you don't understand. There's a reason why Satoshi used largest accumulated difficulty instead of longest chain.	SatoshiLite	43	3	1527194878	999753897051762688	https://twitter.com/SatoshiLite/status/999753897051762688

litecoin 	Litecoin is 99% dominant in Scrypt PoW. LTC has network hashrate of 301 TH/s. The next largest non-merged-mined Scrypt coin (GAME) only has 2 TH/s. Takes less than 1% of the LTC network to 51% attack other Scypt coins. But miners won't attack Litecoin and kill their cash chikun.pic.twitter.com/kj6r7d9KBr	SatoshiLite	765	207	1527194428	999752009346465792	https://twitter.com/SatoshiLite/status/999752009346465792			
	Woah, really?! Then they are succeptible to timing attacks. Nevermind, I guess that's exactly what happened. Lol.	SatoshiLite	10	0	1527193907	999749826261671936	https://twitter.com/SatoshiLite/status/999749826261671936			
bitcoin 	It's 99% dominant versus Bitcoin, which is only like 85% dominant because of BCH.	SatoshiLite	5	1	1527193650	999748746391900160	https://twitter.com/SatoshiLite/status/999748746391900160			
	Yup	SatoshiLite	2	0	1527192447	999743700975562752	https://twitter.com/SatoshiLite/status/999743700975562752			
	Once they get other miners to quit. They can just not mine and only mine to overrun a chain when some other miners find a block. Very quickly, no one else will bother. So it won't be that costly. Remember there's no financial benefit. This is if someone just wants to kill it.	SatoshiLite	10	0	1527191690	999740528261455872	https://twitter.com/SatoshiLite/status/999740528261455872			
bitcoin litecoin 	I'm talking about Litecoin not Bitcoin.	SatoshiLite	4	0	1527191414	999739370209918976	https://twitter.com/SatoshiLite/status/999739370209918976			
	If they 51% attack and mine empty blocks and orphan all other blocks. Rest of miners will leave. People can't move coins, so no one buys and price drops. This makes it even less profitable to mine. It likely won't recover until community hard forks to another PoW.	SatoshiLite	13	1	1527191244	999738656414814208	https://twitter.com/SatoshiLite/status/999738656414814208			
	It's not likely, but it's possible if BTC becomes a huge threat. But all they can do is take down one coin and not all of cryptocurrency.	SatoshiLite	14	2	1527190873	999737101817069568	https://twitter.com/SatoshiLite/status/999737101817069568			
	2 weeks if we lose 75% of mining hashrate. Tell me how that's likely. And even then blocks will be 10 mins as oppose to 2.5 minutes. So LTC will be as sluggish as BTC for 2 weeks. Not the end of the world. And we are talking about losing 3/4 of the hasrate permanently.	SatoshiLite	4	0	1527190634	999736099445460992	https://twitter.com/SatoshiLite/status/999736099445460992			
	No, because the mining attack happened before that fight.	SatoshiLite	6	0	1527190493	999735505091612675	https://twitter.com/SatoshiLite/status/999735505091612675			
	No, because BCH is a much less profitable coin to mine. It can't handle all the BTC miners moving to it. Whereas, BTC can easily absorb the BCH miners.	SatoshiLite	12	0	1527187732	999723923745918976	https://twitter.com/SatoshiLite/status/999723923745918976			
	Not really. Miners will just spin up elsewhere because it would be profitable to mine. And worse case, difficult adjusts in a week or 2.	SatoshiLite	10	0	1527186333	999718057827221504	https://twitter.com/SatoshiLite/status/999718057827221504

	Sure, state actors are the biggest threat.	SatoshiLite	37	2	1527179156	999687954522980352	https://twitter.com/SatoshiLite/status/999687954522980352			
	Should be easy. Just have everyone orphan any block that is not mined with that one algorithm.	SatoshiLite	12	0	1527178695	999686021787729920	https://twitter.com/SatoshiLite/status/999686021787729920			
bitcoin litecoin 	No, Litecoin and Bitcoin uses different POW algorithm.	SatoshiLite	8	1	1527177695	999681829069250560	https://twitter.com/SatoshiLite/status/999681829069250560			
	I didn't say it was not possible. Just less incentives to.	SatoshiLite	7	0	1527177659	999681677768015872	https://twitter.com/SatoshiLite/status/999681677768015872

bitcoin litecoin 	Bitcoin Gold got 51% attacked. Miners have no issue with attacking BTG because if it dies, they could easily switch to mine another coin that also uses Equihash POW. This is not the case for Bitcoin/Litecoin where they are the dominant coin for their respective mining algorithms.https://twitter.com/el33th4xor/status/999453788955074562 …	SatoshiLite	1216	356	1527177550	999681220639318017	https://twitter.com/SatoshiLite/status/999681220639318017

bitcoin 	It matters when someone faked a proof being Satoshi and managed to convince a lot of people that he's Satoshi. And he's using that fame to spew his bullshit. I'm just calling it out as I see it. You are right, Bitcoin works. But always better to have less scammers.	SatoshiLite	99	2	1527148044	999557461601239041	https://twitter.com/SatoshiLite/status/999557461601239041			
	I'm guessing you believe he's Satoshi. I guess to each his own.	SatoshiLite	41	0	1527147815	999556503156633602	https://twitter.com/SatoshiLite/status/999556503156633602			
	Well I'm sure you've read Satoshi's emails and forum posts. It's not character traits I want him to have. It's what's he shown before faketoshi showed up.	SatoshiLite	86	2	1527147627	999555713314635776	https://twitter.com/SatoshiLite/status/999555713314635776			
	"Craig Wright recently told Rwanda ""I've got more money than your country."" Wow. Watch the whole video linked below. I don't know about you, but I sure didn't think Satoshi Nakamoto was an egomaniacal, foul-mouthed, patent troll.https://twitter.com/WhalePanda/status/999279287512584192 …"	SatoshiLite	2678	610	1527146829	999552366813659136	https://twitter.com/SatoshiLite/status/999552366813659136			
litecoin 	And I say Litecoin is boring all the time. Boring is good. Boring means you don't get hacked. And I use the emoji all the time. I can't help it. Sorry.	SatoshiLite	6	0	1527141122	999528430885421057	https://twitter.com/SatoshiLite/status/999528430885421057			
	Ask the Verge devs I guess.	SatoshiLite	3	0	1527137258	999512222299635713	https://twitter.com/SatoshiLite/status/999512222299635713

	Again, if people ask me nicely, I will say what I think. My original tweet has nothing to do with DigiByte, except that DigiByte and probably 100 other coins also do 5x algorithms. I can't help it if you guys get offended because you are drawing the wrong conclusions.	SatoshiLite	36	0	1527136939	999510884111212544	https://twitter.com/SatoshiLite/status/999510884111212544			
	That's not my article. I just found it informative. You should ask the author why he didn't mention the fixes. But the article was focused on Verge, which doesn't have the fixes. So what's your point? No one is attacking DigiByte or saying that it has the same bugs.	SatoshiLite	3	0	1527136763	999510147343904768	https://twitter.com/SatoshiLite/status/999510147343904768			
	Sure, Verge's diff adjustment is broken. When that happens, the 5x algo feature actually made security worse. So that's a potential flaw inherent to all 5x coins. I do believe that MultiShield is much better battletested than DarkGravityWell. So DigiByte likely not affected.	SatoshiLite	235	65	1527136583	999509392553738240	https://twitter.com/SatoshiLite/status/999509392553738240			
	I'm not sure why he got offended. And I was starting to like DigiByte too. Was told Jared doesn't attack other coins or people. Oh well.	SatoshiLite	15	1	1527136195	999507762995384320	https://twitter.com/SatoshiLite/status/999507762995384320

	And I didn't say it was. Just that it exacerbated the problem. I can't go into details in a tweet, so that's why I linked to the article. Jeez	SatoshiLite	3	0	1527135624	999505369356353536	https://twitter.com/SatoshiLite/status/999505369356353536

	I didn't know DigiByte owns the 5 algo system. I thought it was started by MyriadCoin. So I guess I attacked MyriadCoin and every other coin that uses 5 algorithms.	SatoshiLite	2	0	1527135338	999504167809908736	https://twitter.com/SatoshiLite/status/999504167809908736			
	Really? Where? Read the article. Maybe you guys are a bit sensitive. Even if my mention of 5 algo was a dig at digibyte, still has nothing to do with MultiShield.	SatoshiLite	4	0	1527135242	999503764997390337	https://twitter.com/SatoshiLite/status/999503764997390337

	What does MultiShield/DigiShield have to do with Verge? I didn't think Verge uses that. I wasn't attacking DigiByte in any way, so not sure why you are so defensive.	SatoshiLite	52	0	1527133622	999496970384297986	https://twitter.com/SatoshiLite/status/999496970384297986
