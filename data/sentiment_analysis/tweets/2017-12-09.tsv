bitcoin 	The motivation of the biggest HODL’ers in # Bitcoin is primarily to escape the fiat Ponzi nightmare. The reason they don’t sell now is that central banks are still breathing.

bitcoin 	I would posit # Bitcoin (per protocol that constantly shrinks supply) is the inverse of the bank’s Ponzi (infinite rehypothication) scheme that created the multi-trillion demand for non-Ponzi Bitcoin.

	Personally I've found Stoicism to not be quite counterproductive. It seems to make me suppress/deny emotions, which doesn't prevent them eventually coming up.

	Yeah, XRP is cheaper and faster, but not in a meaningful way for P2P use, IMO. Both cost less than a penny to transact with. BCH doesn’t confirm instantly, but it still shows up right away.

	you generally want a plan and stick to it. it's a dollar allocation it's purpose is ear-marked: expressing my sentiment in the market. mostly I'm hodling BTC cold.	adam3us	4	0	1512851404	939593008499998720	https://twitter.com/adam3us/status/939593008499998720			
	I don't use all dip buying dollar allocation funds at once: buy the dip in 20% steps down, usually want ammunition for 3 or 4 sets of 20% downwards buys.	adam3us	32	0	1512851250	939592360370978816	https://twitter.com/adam3us/status/939592360370978816			
	just keep a few extra % in dollars to buy dips. collectively people doing that provide plunge protection and stabilize. you also profit from the dips (sell dip coins on the bounce for dollars, hold profits in BTC and be ready to do it again) also panic sellers learn to hodl.	adam3us	42	7	1512850943	939591074355363840	https://twitter.com/adam3us/status/939591074355363840

	Makes sense to have a few % dollar allocation for dip buying, and fork shorting in my opinion, because to speak in the market you have to trade. Retain the cash allocation by selling to cash the bounce and keep the profit in BTC to hodl. panic sellers the learn via the market.	adam3us	1	0	1512845932	939570056802865152	https://twitter.com/adam3us/status/939570056802865152

	I don't know - somehow feels like cheating. I've preferred risk capital in it for philosophical hodl commitment - I really don't want to sell even part as derisk, as I want to HODL it all.

bitcoin 	ICO correction could see bitcoin dominance index back at 90%. I wonder if some ICOs invest the capital in other ICOs - would that cause ICO contagion run if the ICO speculation sneezed? Also some self seed (eg huge discounts to insiders to seed start, or even loans repaid after).	adam3us	70	15	1512804773	939397422115012608	https://twitter.com/adam3us/status/939397422115012608

bitcoin 	Nobody on the financial regulator side wants to kill the goose that lays the golden egg. But the forces of fiat currency have a lot on their side - not just guns and bombs, but clear arguments that bitcoin is compromised by miner centralization and similar factors.https://twitter.com/saifedean/status/939228546836389893 …	leashless	6	1	1512791335	939341059779383297	https://twitter.com/leashless/status/939341059779383297			
	The next phase of this situation isn't going to be decided by free markets, anyway. It's gone too far. There might be some more price fluctuations, but financial regulators are going to step in. Too much, too fast, and things will soon get complicated.https://twitter.com/saifedean/status/939228546836389893 …	leashless	8	2	1512791253	939340715603005440	https://twitter.com/leashless/status/939340715603005440			
bitcoin 	It's a mess. This is what revolutions look like, for sure. Enormous redistributions of wealth. Two paradigms colliding. But to hold, bitcoin would have to be actually distributed, not run by miners and massively concentrated in a few (lucky) hands. It's unstable, profoundly so.https://twitter.com/saifedean/status/939228546836389893 …	leashless	39	10	1512790614	939338035170332672	https://twitter.com/leashless/status/939338035170332672
