	Who cares who donated to the Verge funding campaign. The campaign was for them adding XVG. They did it. Done. I don't care for LTC to be 2nd. Just want to support more coins. Also, I didn't know TokenPay was a separate coin. Why did you donate to help Verge?!?	SatoshiLite	77	5	1523982066	986278387881721856	https://twitter.com/SatoshiLite/status/986278387881721856

	I think having more places to spend crypto is good. But I do hope they accept more than just Verge. It's quite hard for people to get XVG just to spend on PornHub. It's a step forward, but having to buy a partner is not a good precedent. Merchants shouldn't need to be bribed...

	Should not happen at all. It may genuinely be the case that someone concurrently discovered the same thing, or else was unaware of your work. In which case, you should politely let the authors know about your work so they can cite it as appropriate in the future.	el33th4xor	0	0	1523988934	986307193719926787	https://twitter.com/el33th4xor/status/986307193719926787			
	These seem solvable with crowd oracles, multisig, and stake, so I'm hopeful.	el33th4xor	2	0	1523967797	986218539530022917	https://twitter.com/el33th4xor/status/986218539530022917			
	Overall, it's a great first step, and, because Twitter provides so little added value due to behind the scenes with filtering and ranking, Memo's decentralized version might be able to offer an alternative. But it has to solve account squatting/impersonation in the short term.	el33th4xor	3	0	1523967749	986218337058336769	https://twitter.com/el33th4xor/status/986218337058336769			
	It is already suffering from account squatters and scammers. Of course, Twitter does so incredibly little, so incompetently, that a totally decentralized version can actually compete with it.	el33th4xor	3	0	1523967577	986217617080844289	https://twitter.com/el33th4xor/status/986217617080844289			
	"2. Twitter performs some functionality behind the scenes. Account adjudication (eg ""I'm the rightful el33th4x0r""), blue check verification, deterring unwanted speech, etc, all happen behind the scenes. Memo doesn't seem to do any of them yet."	el33th4xor	1	2	1523967504	986217311127375872	https://twitter.com/el33th4xor/status/986217311127375872			
	There are two interesting issues with Memo: 1. It is heavily dependent on on-chain recording. This isn't a problem now, as BCH has plenty of space. But if the service grows, it'll put pressure on the underlying chain to scale better. It thus serves as a stress test.	el33th4xor	3	0	1523967369	986216744758005761	https://twitter.com/el33th4xor/status/986216744758005761			
	So, in the final analysis, is that wrong? The best art imitates life so well, you cannot tell where one ends and the other begins.https://twitter.com/btcfork/status/986168574845833218 …	el33th4xor	8	0	1523966909	986214814698692608	https://twitter.com/el33th4xor/status/986214814698692608			
	That should not be happening. Please report as appropriate. Plagiarism is, and should be, career ending.	el33th4xor	1	0	1523965989	986210954542223361	https://twitter.com/el33th4xor/status/986210954542223361			
	I like http://memo.cash , but the service seems to reveal and connect people's real world identities to addresses on the chain. Be sure to tumble your coins before using it.	el33th4xor	20	6	1523943530	986116756803596289	https://twitter.com/el33th4xor/status/986116756803596289

	Yeah, honestly, I like the fact that Earn has made my inbox much more sane. It acts like a filter, and then I can direct the really important emails to my actual inbox.

	I agree Earn isn't a great business & that Balaji's post was revisionist history, but I think if spammers have to pay money, that's an improvement on the current system in which it costs them $0.

	"5. I'd argue that China actually loses from many of the policies we see as ""beating"" us.
