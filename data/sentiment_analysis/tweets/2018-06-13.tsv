	One could use PoW+DAG+modified heaviest chain. That'd be GHOST. One could use PoS+DAG+Avalanche, as in Ava coin. Or do PoS+multisets+Avalanche just as well. Or do PoS+forests or chain+Snowball.

	Because we lived through many pyramid schemes and developed the vocabulary, understanding, and the legal frameworks -- which altogether constitute an immune response -- to address them.

	This concludes today's # microlecture. I hope it clarifies the discourse around coins and avoids confounding mechanisms that are independent.	el33th4xor	201	19	1528907101	1006935483144900613	https://twitter.com/el33th4xor/status/1006935483144900613		#	
	The big design decisions in coins aren't between PoW vs. PoS. They are between the consensus protocols themselves, as they determine performance, scale, energy expenditure, and security.	el33th4xor	137	29	1528907020	1006935143754469378	https://twitter.com/el33th4xor/status/1006935143754469378			
	One could use Avalanche either with PoW or PoS, if one wanted. One could use a PoS coin, which had in it a PoW mechanism to make sure that a rogue but staked actor does not flood the network layer.	el33th4xor	70	12	1528906250	1006931913637023744	https://twitter.com/el33th4xor/status/1006931913637023744			
	There are many consensus protocols (mechanisms), and there are many Sybil control mechanisms. These two kinds of mechanisms are distinct and separate. A system or coin will end up combining one with the other. Of course, not all combos make sense. But many combos are possible.	el33th4xor	102	25	1528906247	1006931901221933056	https://twitter.com/el33th4xor/status/1006931901221933056			
	"PoW, by itself, isn't a consensus mechanism. In BTC/BCH, it works with the heaviest/""longest"" chain selection rule to achieve consensus. PoW by itself can be used to thwart spam, as originally proposed by Dwork&Naor. PoW doesn't get you agreement, it gets you rate limiting."	el33th4xor	157	23	1528906237	1006931858519658501	https://twitter.com/el33th4xor/status/1006931858519658501			
	Proof-of-Work and Proof-of-Stake are **sybil control mechanisms**. PoS doesn't achieve consensus by itself. It has to be coupled with a protocol, such as PBFT, or Ben-Or, or Tendermint/Cosmos, or Avalanche, to make decisions.	el33th4xor	210	47	1528906206	1006931729679044608	https://twitter.com/el33th4xor/status/1006931729679044608			
	Ok, there is a terribly wrong framework emerging around consensus protocols. People think that PoW and PoS are consensus protocols, and that they are the only two consensus protocols out there. This is false. Let me explain.	el33th4xor	1043	408	1528906189	1006931658338177024	https://twitter.com/el33th4xor/status/1006931658338177024

	You shouldn't trust any single entity. And it's impossible to know exactly who is behind which amount of hashpower.

	First of all, is Iota decentralized? If not, it's not on the same playing field.

	In almost all these cases, it comes down to some doctors who defrauded the NIH. The simple solution of scrutinizing just the doctors isn't politically acceptable.

	FGOファンでなくてもボドゲ常連でなくてもサクっと遊べるのが魅力的。上級者ルールもあり間口が広い商品だと思いました。素直に楽しかったのでまたやりたい。FGOをやってみようかな、と沼に入りそうな気配もある。ボドゲとしても根付いてくれると嬉しいです。以上です。http://duel.fate-go.jp	mochi_wsj	4	2	1528880517	1006823981691887616	https://twitter.com/mochi_wsj/status/1006823981691887616			
	注意点としては第一弾パックで対戦をする場合、デッキ構成にかかるコストの関係で「マシュ」は必ず必要になること。どのキャラがでるかはランダムなので、運が悪いと「マシュが出ない」なんてことも？運営さんには必ずマシュが入ったスターターパックなどの検討をお願いしたいです。pic.twitter.com/pN9PAQnnJY	mochi_wsj	5	5	1528880517	1006823979468943361	https://twitter.com/mochi_wsj/status/1006823979468943361			
	ルールもシンプルなのでボドゲを初めてプレイする人にもとても親切という印象。一方で戦略、先読み、引きの運といった要素がバランスよくあるのでガチ勢もしっかり楽しめそうです。私の対戦相手はFGOファンの人でしたが「マスターの気分が味わえる」「対人戦ができるとは」という感想をお持ちでしたpic.twitter.com/81ntotXPkL	mochi_wsj	2	5	1528880516	1006823974662230017	https://twitter.com/mochi_wsj/status/1006823974662230017			
	肝心のゲームですが実際プレイしてみました。楽しかった！私はFate映画・アニメを見たこともないしFGOゲームもプレイしたことはないのですが、特別な用語を覚えたりする必要がないのですんなりと入れました。ゲームの準備（インスト）に必要な時間は数分、１ゲームの長さも10分強。サクサク遊べます。pic.twitter.com/kBH0xbwz7c	mochi_wsj	1	4	1528880514	1006823967888494594	https://twitter.com/mochi_wsj/status/1006823967888494594			
	FGOのコレクションアイテムである一方でボードゲームなので、ボードゲームを入り口にFGOに触れてもらえるよう、大会などの構想はあるとのこと。順を追って公開していくようです。pic.twitter.com/22QOJZ8hOE	mochi_wsj	2	2	1528880513	1006823962351988736	https://twitter.com/mochi_wsj/status/1006823962351988736			
	また、Duel商品にスマホゲームFGO用のアイテムコードなどの封入予定もなし。「DuelをやらないとFGOの楽しみが減ってしまうということはしない」とは塩川さん。「まずは立ち上げをしっかりして皆さんに受け入れてもらえるのが最優先」、しかし横方向・縦方向の展開に野望や展望はあるとのこと。pic.twitter.com/qnaEpdn5Z1	mochi_wsj	1	2	1528880511	1006823956827996161	https://twitter.com/mochi_wsj/status/1006823956827996161			
	商品の各ユニット（1,200円）はミニフィギュア、コマンドカード、ステータスカードにスキルカードで構成。ボードゲームとして対戦をするには各陣営3ユニット分が必要です。ゲームシートはホームページからダウンロードが可能。キャラごとに「でやすい」「でにくい」という設定はないそうです。pic.twitter.com/8cEK2k7ES7	mochi_wsj	1	4	1528880510	1006823951186657282	https://twitter.com/mochi_wsj/status/1006823951186657282

	I've spent years as the only woman on stage as conferences, with some half-assed excuses from organisers about how there aren't any women in the industry. Now I'm older, wiser, know that's rubbish and in a position to tell them they don't get to use my profile or expertise.	charliehalkett	3	0	1528921273	1006994925408448512	https://twitter.com/charliehalkett/status/1006994925408448512

	I'd love to get to a stage where we don't analyses individual panels, but we are so far away from anything remotely sensible that the time has come to hold conf organisers to measurable targets.	charliehalkett	1	0	1528920919	1006993440507334656	https://twitter.com/charliehalkett/status/1006993440507334656			
	Also - I turned down yet another conference last week because I was going to be the only woman on stage all day. It's still just ridiculous and doesn't seem to have got any better over my 17 odd years in insurance.	charliehalkett	1	0	1528920832	1006993075166695426	https://twitter.com/charliehalkett/status/1006993075166695426

	I think that when we get to the point where a mere 10% female representation on stage at a major event is treated as surprising/unreasonable, then we will morally be in a position to question both ways. As it is, that's just a bit daft.	charliehalkett	2	0	1528920582	1006992027358322689	https://twitter.com/charliehalkett/status/1006992027358322689
