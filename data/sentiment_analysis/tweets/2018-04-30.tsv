ethereum 	One wins and the other loses. At least Ethereum's brand of sharding doesn't really change the single-chain status quo.	VitalikButerin	9	2	1525116825	991037913151430657	https://twitter.com/VitalikButerin/status/991037913151430657			
ethereum 	In Ethereum sharding, there's no notion of shards being mapped to specific long-term node clusters or geographies etc; it's not like there's a Shanghai shard, Toronto shard, etc. All shards take their (frequently reshuffled) validator sets from globally dispersed nodes.

	A 50/50 network partition would likely have the same consequences as one on a single chain: nothing gets finalized (until either the network comes back together or the leak mechanism kicks in), but unfinalized chains on both sides keep growing.

	Running your own node is like having your own watch. You use it to tell time without relying on others. (e.g. miners) If everyone has their own watch, actual time can only change if everyone agrees to change it. (e.g. DST) Time is only useful when everyone is on the same time.

	True, but then you'd have to enforce that somehow in the real world which is a little tricky (as we've seen with all illegal content sharing)	ummjackson	0	0	1525106035	990992656531472390	https://twitter.com/ummjackson/status/990992656531472390

	Reminder that Cambridge Analytica didn't get their data directly from Facebook - they purchased the profiles from a researcher.

	"There is no blockchain or technology which can legally prevent a ""licensed"" purchaser of your data from reselling that data or giving it away for free to another ""unlicensed"" entity.

	It's more about monetizing your attention as far as I understand it (ie. views) and I guess that could work if advertisers are fans of the model.	ummjackson	3	0	1525103592	990982410228543488	https://twitter.com/ummjackson/status/990982410228543488			
	"I think you're missing the point - I'm saying that once someone has paid for the ""licensed"" version of your data, they can simply copy & paste it to the rest of the world for free.

	Once even a *single* entity possesses a copy of your data, the cat is out of the bag and you should assume your ability to monetize said data disappears. Think of your private data like a pirated mp3 file - it'll ultimately show up on a Napster of data once shared.	ummjackson	31	7	1525103437	990981760308592640	https://twitter.com/ummjackson/status/990981760308592640

bitcoin 	After a few transactions getting stuck in the mempool and then Steam no longer accepting Bitcoin, they lost interest for awhile.

	You argued that you should have equal proportions of each fork. If you don't know about a particular fork, aren't you taking risk in case that fork wins? Isn't it the responsibility of the investor then to know about every fork?	jimmysong	5	0	1525118467	991044798252449792	https://twitter.com/jimmysong/status/991044798252449792

	Probably to save space on disk. But they have the exact same utxo set as of the forking block. Anyway, do you count that or not? Essentially, it's a hybrid of an altcoin and a hard fork and muddies the waters a bit.	jimmysong	0	0	1525116824	991037907812212741	https://twitter.com/jimmysong/status/991037907812212741			
	I ask because I'm genuinely curious. BTCP, for example has a much smaller blockchain than BTC as a result, but essentially does what BCH did, for example, in giving 1 BTCP for each BTC you held as of block 511346.	jimmysong	0	0	1525116489	991036504708444160	https://twitter.com/jimmysong/status/991036504708444160			
	By your formulation, do you include stuff like BTX and BTCP which aren't strictly forks, but have the same effect? That is, they take each UTXO from a certain block and give you the equivalent in their coin, but don't have the same blockchain history.	jimmysong	1	0	1525116364	991035978092634112	https://twitter.com/jimmysong/status/991035978092634112
