	Except there's no hypocrisy. In an uncapped sale, if you don't have early buyer discounts then the incentive is for everyone to buy in the last second. And as I mentioned, your argument implies longer durations, not no time discounts. I've consistently favored long sale durations	VitalikButerin	6	3	1511272775	932971755928350721	https://twitter.com/VitalikButerin/status/932971755928350721			
bitcoin 	It's not about market liquidity. It's about exchange bureaucracy, KYC, wiring funds etc etc. I'd say definitely less trivial than buying $5k of bitcoin.	VitalikButerin	3	2	1511272334	932969908429664256	https://twitter.com/VitalikButerin/status/932969908429664256			
	Also, even if your argument held any water, it's not an argument against discount periods as a concept, it's an argument for lengthening the sale duration and the max discount period.	VitalikButerin	3	2	1511272076	932968826701987840	https://twitter.com/VitalikButerin/status/932968826701987840			
	And the more I think about it, the more I really do think it's opposite from what you think - it's likely *easier* for someone with $500 in wealth to convert that to BTC in a week than it is for someone with $5 million.

	Someone who's struggling to pay for rent that much would not be able to meaningfully participate in sales regardless of how they're structured.	VitalikButerin	5	2	1511271859	932967916324003843	https://twitter.com/VitalikButerin/status/932967916324003843			
	I think you're *massively* overstating the correlation between having money and being able to move it around within 2 weeks. Due to exchanges having withdrawal limits, it may even be in the opposite direction from what you think.	VitalikButerin	3	2	1511271527	932966521680248849	https://twitter.com/VitalikButerin/status/932966521680248849

	The sale was pre-announced and the full discount period lasted 2 weeks. Compare to modern sales that end in 30 seconds.	VitalikButerin	2	2	1511270195	932960935060361216	https://twitter.com/VitalikButerin/status/932960935060361216			
	The sale structure by itself incentivizes waiting, as you have more certainty of valuation. Early buyer discounts compensate for this.	VitalikButerin	2	2	1511270183	932960886557433857	https://twitter.com/VitalikButerin/status/932960886557433857

	The extent to which there is clear feedback from reality is a big factor imo. Diet, for example, can take decades to have clear measurable effects. Hence high tribalism in the meantime.

	Well of course *legal* regimes define things in terms of what the government does about them. That's not really evidence that the government-centric definition is the more useful one.	VitalikButerin	30	3	1511256946	932905365787648000	https://twitter.com/VitalikButerin/status/932905365787648000

bitcoin 	the bitcoin R & D community has been exemplary in all of this. focussed on improving tech, and mostly kept off of social media.

	There is one key difference between Tether and the others above. It has to do with the control they exert over non-customers of theirs. This thread tries to explain it:https://twitter.com/el33th4xor/status/932888673653329920 …	el33th4xor	4	0	1511256048	932901598627532802	https://twitter.com/el33th4xor/status/932901598627532802			
	"It has been 1.5 years since I looked at the Omni code, but I don't recall ""forcefully freeze funds"" as a primitive. They had to monkey patch it in for the hard fork."	el33th4xor	7	0	1511255848	932900762455339008	https://twitter.com/el33th4xor/status/932900762455339008			
	That said, I think it's much more likely that the crowd underestimates the counterparty risk at $0.00, which it isn't, as today's events have shown.	el33th4xor	1	0	1511253934	932892731743129601	https://twitter.com/el33th4xor/status/932892731743129601			
	The observed price is capped at $1. It's not that the utility is precisely offset by risk, but there's some excess, which draws people to the coin.	el33th4xor	1	0	1511253714	932891811374301186	https://twitter.com/el33th4xor/status/932891811374301186			
	This is the most sensible explanation that I've heard. If a tether lets an arbitrageur make $1.20 by shuffling the cash quickly between exchanges, and the risk premium is $0.09, he buys for $1 and pockets $0.11.	el33th4xor	1	0	1511253623	932891430086946816	https://twitter.com/el33th4xor/status/932891430086946816			
	That might open them up to all kinds of legal liabilities.	el33th4xor	26	1	1511253329	932890196194025472	https://twitter.com/el33th4xor/status/932890196194025472			
	But this episode shows that Tether has control and is acting as a record keeper *even for usdt transfers between third parties*. These people aren't vetted. Regulators will think that if, say, Al Qeada touched a single coin, Tether was the facilitator.	el33th4xor	27	4	1511253261	932889910847131648	https://twitter.com/el33th4xor/status/932889910847131648			
	Normally, an exchange only performs AML/KYC at its own boundary. They check their own customers, and can claim that they have no idea about the peer-to-peer transactions between their clients and third parties.	el33th4xor	10	1	1511253038	932888973151817728	https://twitter.com/el33th4xor/status/932888973151817728			
	One of the many surprising things about Tether's getting hacked and unhacked was the level of control they exert over this blockchain. It's hard to distinguish it from a regular database under sole custody.	el33th4xor	210	52	1511252966	932888673653329920	https://twitter.com/el33th4xor/status/932888673653329920			
	The level of control they exert over this blockchain is unusual, to the point where it could trigger regulation.	el33th4xor	11	0	1511252871	932888272682078208	https://twitter.com/el33th4xor/status/932888272682078208

	Ah, I see, so your assumption is that all tether receiving exchanges use a single commingled receiving address instead of issuing per-user addresses a la bip32. How do we know that?	el33th4xor	5	0	1511241445	932840348530831361	https://twitter.com/el33th4xor/status/932840348530831361			
	Your assumption that a hacker who controls the victim's key would necessarily send the coins first to his own wallet, and only then to an exchange, is wrong.	el33th4xor	5	1	1511240253	932835350187094018	https://twitter.com/el33th4xor/status/932835350187094018			
	If I steal your btc in your Trezor, issue a transaction to GDAX, convert to LTC there, how many transactions would you expect to see on the BTC blockchain? What do we see here?	el33th4xor	5	0	1511239837	932833607667761152	https://twitter.com/el33th4xor/status/932833607667761152			
	That address doesn't necessarily belong to the attacker. It's possible that he sent directly to an exchange, where they go into a general pool, and he gets out other crypto. They should freeze and investigate if any exchange is affected, which is what they are doing, presumably.	el33th4xor	6	0	1511239428	932831888363753472	https://twitter.com/el33th4xor/status/932831888363753472			
	There is a simple send. It is on the blockchain. The coins at that address are rendered immovable by a patch at some, but probably not all, exchanges. But they may already have been trades for other crypto. They may yet be traded at an exchange that has not upgraded.	el33th4xor	3	0	1511238961	932829933579116546	https://twitter.com/el33th4xor/status/932829933579116546			
bitcoin 	In the Omni git repo. You'll find it very familiar. It's based on an old version of bitcoind.	el33th4xor	3	0	1511238447	932827776280694784	https://twitter.com/el33th4xor/status/932827776280694784			
	A few trades, couple of passes through tumblers, and they can cash it right out at another exchange. Or bring it right back to Bitfinex.	el33th4xor	8	1	1511238238	932826899213987840	https://twitter.com/el33th4xor/status/932826899213987840			
	One thing is certain: if you accept tether, you now know that the ledger can be undone under you, and you will be out the crypto you traded for tether.	el33th4xor	55	20	1511238012	932825949703258112	https://twitter.com/el33th4xor/status/932825949703258112			
	Or this could be an engineered episode. Perhaps to take attention away from other news coverage. Or perhaps to take some air out of an ongoing tether+btc pump.	el33th4xor	34	7	1511237942	932825656689287169	https://twitter.com/el33th4xor/status/932825656689287169			
	No. Plenty of others trade tether for crypto. And it's not clear yet if the patch came in time to freeze downstream trades. The frozen address may belong to an exchange, not the attacker. In which case, someone is out $30m, and it's not Tether Inc.https://twitter.com/Bitfinexed/status/932820144908308482 …	el33th4xor	54	16	1511237810	932825104542711808	https://twitter.com/el33th4xor/status/932825104542711808			
	*Just yesterday*, I was saying that Tether needs to offer a risk premium to compensate for them getting hacked.https://twitter.com/el33th4xor/status/932289729751584768 …	el33th4xor	92	18	1511237409	932823420621881345	https://twitter.com/el33th4xor/status/932823420621881345			
	So you have to build security into the coins. Our Covenants and Vaults were designed for this purpose, but there may be other techniques to improve user security. Use one. Better yet, use a few.	el33th4xor	9	1	1511236218	932818427273605120	https://twitter.com/el33th4xor/status/932818427273605120			
	I used to work on operating systems before cryptocurrencies. So I can say this: They don't know how to make deployed OSes any more secure than they are. It's open season every day, and coins are the bug bounty.	el33th4xor	20	6	1511236097	932817920203223040	https://twitter.com/el33th4xor/status/932817920203223040			
	At a higher level, our critical infrastructure is nowhere near secure enough to handle high value assets. As a coin developer, you can't outsource security to the OS developer.	el33th4xor	7	3	1511236015	932817576698175488	https://twitter.com/el33th4xor/status/932817576698175488			
	Bitfinex got hacked a year ago and we never found out what happened, how the hacker got in. Hope Tether figures it out this time.	el33th4xor	15	3	1511235950	932817300712853505	https://twitter.com/el33th4xor/status/932817300712853505			
	Hate to say this but: if Omni had our Covenants and Vaults, they could have recovered from getting hacked without an emergency hard fork. /Cc @ ittayeyal @ maltemoeser	el33th4xor	11	0	1511235859	932816920180506624	https://twitter.com/el33th4xor/status/932816920180506624			@ @
	Looks like Tether got hacked and lost some coins. This explains why they wouldn't be able to use the revoke feature, and instead had to hard-fork to freeze the address.	el33th4xor	16	5	1511235677	932816158129975296	https://twitter.com/el33th4xor/status/932816158129975296

	Critical announcement from Tether, posted by Omni, to explain the recently frozen address: https://tether.to/tether-critical-announcement/ …	el33th4xor	48	19	1511235330	932814700160495616	https://twitter.com/el33th4xor/status/932814700160495616			
	This was a patch added to the code specifically to block this address. If they had a revoke API, for some reason, they didn't use it. They monkey patched the code to block that specific address.	el33th4xor	6	0	1511235048	932813519484985344	https://twitter.com/el33th4xor/status/932813519484985344			
	Tether quietly did a hard fork to blacklist a specific address and freeze funds. Three questions: 1. Who controls the Omni ledger and who can perform these kinds of operations? 2. Why was this address blacklisted? 3. Which other addresses are next in line?https://twitter.com/ofnumbers/status/932782528351686657 …	el33th4xor	339	178	1511232546	932803027207045120	https://twitter.com/el33th4xor/status/932803027207045120			
	Absolutely. Crypto is a fractal copy of the world at large. Now, who exactly is the crypto-Bannon? Which press outlet is crypto-fakenews? So many questions.	el33th4xor	30	7	1511230645	932795053772124160	https://twitter.com/el33th4xor/status/932795053772124160

	And if you're a smaller pool, that 0.016% potential orphan loss from transmission delay is immeasurably small compared to natural mining variance, and its financial impact is in the noise compared to daily price fluctuations.	el33th4xor	2	1	1511226737	932778660037255170	https://twitter.com/el33th4xor/status/932778660037255170

	Because we have an environment, in the smart contract environment, in which speech acts are performative - speech *is* an action like value transfer. I don't know how the courts will treat that in the long run. http://strangehorizons.com/non-fiction/reviews/new-model-army-by-adam-roberts/ … may be worth a thought here, in a few years.	leashless	1	0	1511256291	932902620208992256	https://twitter.com/leashless/status/932902620208992256			
bitcoin 	And whether we are in the firing line in that scenario depends on cultural factors. If they're using bitcoin or fashcoin or whatever, 1488coin, even if it's an eth fork, we survive. If it's an eth contract on main net, maybe we live our lives in hiding at best.

ethereum 	Here's the thing.

	Potential catastrophic loss of funds across the whole network.

	The parts that can be publicly audited are: every single USD token issued is completely visible. What can't be publicly audited - the USD backing those tokens- is *inherently* not possible for the general public to audit because of how conventional financial systems work.	peterktodd	14	1	1511247443	932865506813628416	https://twitter.com/peterktodd/status/932865506813628416			
	3) Putting trades of a centralized asset on a decentralized chain makes it much more difficult for Tether to censor specific transactions; it's a *good thing* that censoring this theft tx requires a invasive and publicly visible software update across a bunch of exchanges.	peterktodd	19	1	1511247322	932865001093771269	https://twitter.com/peterktodd/status/932865001093771269			
	1) Omni is certainly not the best possible tech for this, but there aren't many good choices that you can actually use in production right now. 2) Even with the best possible tech, using decentralized systems to audit centralized ones has a lot of advantages.	peterktodd	28	1	1511247128	932864187637927937	https://twitter.com/peterktodd/status/932864187637927937
