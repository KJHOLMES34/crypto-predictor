	They would be better off waiting a few months to learn how to secure their investment before throwing massive sums of money into it. Exchanges are like Russian roulette. They will *always* get hacked.

	It’s not that I don’t agree that key management is a HUGE responsibility that many people don’t want, it’s that I think you have to consider exchanges as predators. They are not there to help you and some will prey on you.

	Crypto’s dirty little secret is that exchanges don’t get hacked. They get “hacked.” You can’t trust others with your crypto. Look at Mt Gox.

	I don’t know about Robinhood but Abra ensures the value of BTC the user is holding stays fixed to the currency the user wants to hold. Abra is the counterparty to the user in all cases.

ethereum 	If you would like to receive some StellarFork tokens (not Lumens), you need to follow the instructions in this blog post. The tokens run on the Ethereum network. (2/2)https://medium.com/@haydentiff/how-to-create-a-stellarfork-wallet-in-edge-a297caf12e4?source=linkShare-c4107ebb5102-1521426545 …	haydentiff	0	1	1521426600	975559988402941952	https://twitter.com/haydentiff/status/975559988402941952			@haydentiff
	I want to copy (fork) the Stellar network. While preparing to do that (it’s going to take a lot of us), I’m distributing a token to everyone who wants to be involved. Once we fork the network, a new currency will be generated and then airdropped to token holders.

	Without a single controller of that data aggregating and repackaging it in secret, dangerous monopolies like FB should be much harder to form.

	But while we obviously need to address security, my interest in this is in fairness, market structure and competition.

	Not really. It's a much more radical vision than just paying fractions of cents for stuff.

	Sure, anyone can now run ML algorithms on on-chain transactions (note: not raw PII data, which would have to reside off-chain), but it's now a free-for-all.

	Well, the business model would be that users are compensated for their content based on some commonly agreed metric of attention, etc. But the bigger point, I believe, is that by decentralizing control of data you undermine FB's monopoly to use it.	mikejcasey	1	0	1521414531	975509366727237632	https://twitter.com/mikejcasey/status/975509366727237632

	Yup - exactly right. It's more of an ongoing study than anything. It's helped tremendously many times over and I'm interested to see how it evolves. The previous trend/channel in 2016 is a great examplepic.twitter.com/cUO0wXOiDi	VentureCoinist	10	3	1521499941	975867601518645248	https://twitter.com/VentureCoinist/status/975867601518645248

	13/ In conclusion - the $ BTC trend in this study is still alive, and I will continue to use it as my rough timing guide until that changes.pic.twitter.com/OtmFD4Dhwn	VentureCoinist	257	55	1521499512	975865800539033605	https://twitter.com/VentureCoinist/status/975865800539033605			
	12/ Hopefully this study/examination of my channel helps any of you who had used it or were looking at the same trend.	VentureCoinist	30	1	1521499512	975865799784128513	https://twitter.com/VentureCoinist/status/975865799784128513			
	11/ I'm not changing the trendline to fit a narrative or because I'm a permabull...I'm acknowledging where the original support was broken yet a truly parallel channel support is still valid.	VentureCoinist	20	2	1521499511	975865798848790528	https://twitter.com/VentureCoinist/status/975865798848790528			
	10/ My takeaway from this is that the $ BTC channel has not yet been broken - however a daily close below the white trendline would invalidate that.	VentureCoinist	16	2	1521499511	975865798014087168	https://twitter.com/VentureCoinist/status/975865798014087168			
	9/ There are tons of tools you can use to analyze/identify a trend. This is only ONE of them. Others are not more/less correct. I combine the channel analysis with fibs + horizontal levels regardless.	VentureCoinist	15	1	1521499511	975865797225562114	https://twitter.com/VentureCoinist/status/975865797225562114			
	8/ I don't want to dismiss the original line, but I do believe the newer trendline is significant especially since its truly parallel.	VentureCoinist	29	1	1521499511	975865796407656448	https://twitter.com/VentureCoinist/status/975865796407656448			
	7/ Due to this subtle difference having a bigger discrepancy later on - the original $ BTC channel support is broken...the newer channel support which is truly parallel was respected.pic.twitter.com/It50D4G2rU	VentureCoinist	22	2	1521499510	975865794117513217	https://twitter.com/VentureCoinist/status/975865794117513217			
	6/ The interesting part about the new trendline is that its slope actually matches the slope of the resistance line making them parallel - important channel characteristic The original support line (green) was off slightly > over longer timeframes the trajectory is far differentpic.twitter.com/d7Xx6DUDjH	VentureCoinist	22	3	1521499509	975865790619705346	https://twitter.com/VentureCoinist/status/975865790619705346			
	5/ Early last week someone pointed out a different trendline (white) that was connected to the February '18 low instead of the July '17 low I had been using. *to stay true to being 'objective' (tweet 2) I had never adjusted the trendline*pic.twitter.com/1gv8PJckzC	VentureCoinist	16	2	1521499509	975865788304310272	https://twitter.com/VentureCoinist/status/975865788304310272			
	4/ By not changing the trendlines - it acted as a consistent guide for when $ BTC has been cheap or expensive according to the trend. Recently - this original support was breached. This was a bearish sign or an indicator that this trend is no longer valid.	VentureCoinist	21	1	1521499509	975865787490512896	https://twitter.com/VentureCoinist/status/975865787490512896			
	3/ For example: I've used this $ BTC trendline channel more than any other chart as a rough timing guide for allocation shifts, trades, and as a valuation tool. I made it mid last year, and havn't changed it.pic.twitter.com/VRDzhZvui8	VentureCoinist	37	4	1521499508	975865784810401794	https://twitter.com/VentureCoinist/status/975865784810401794			
	2/ This implies a few things: - I must be consistent with the way I identify/mark trendlines or supports and resistances - I won't adjust or morph a line to fit a narrative/view	VentureCoinist	19	1	1521499508	975865783904477184	https://twitter.com/VentureCoinist/status/975865783904477184
