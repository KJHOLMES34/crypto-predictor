	"Anything that does not pass the first line is just lame (unless it's unavoidable, eg. for ""truth oracle"" type applications).

	"What's the line? For me, there are two key lines: * Security model.

	The challenge period is a hallmark of any interactive game; it applies to plasma and even truebit.

	Plasma requires trust only for liveness, not safety. Very fundamentally different than certificate authorities. A Plasma chain getting hacked just creates a splat on the blockchain (and with Plasma Cash even doing that is expensive), not a big hack and data leak or whatever.

bitcoin 	To be fair, *no* language is historically path independent.

	Yes. Or rather, if you have sharding, the increases the max total safe capacity of plasma chains running on the system.	VitalikButerin	15	7	1528445577	1004999711688818689	https://twitter.com/VitalikButerin/status/1004999711688818689			
	No, it's not! Because finality in plasma requires the merkle root to go on chain. It's state channels that are the latency solution.	VitalikButerin	16	5	1528445559	1004999634769416192	https://twitter.com/VitalikButerin/status/1004999634769416192

	Not really. Well, the sharded chain *itself* needs a consensus mechanism, but you don't need some separate special thing that looks like another consensus mechanism for cross-shard communication specifically.

	That seems like it includes Rootstock. To me, Rootstock is definitely absolutely positively NOT a channel. It's a federated sidechain.	VitalikButerin	12	3	1528443398	1004990570358398976	https://twitter.com/VitalikButerin/status/1004990570358398976

	I don't think framing sharding and plasma as inverses of each other is meaningful; they are opposites in that one is an L1 and the other is an L2, but they use different tech, have different failure modes and approach fundamentally different concerns.

They’re the new laggards.pic.twitter.com/TVUeXJFpMH	haydentiff	30	3	1528493307	1005199902811607040	https://twitter.com/haydentiff/status/1005199902811607040			@

ripple 	Chris Larsen, Arthur, and Jed had a founders agreement. That was used to govern the XRP, I believe. They each issued themselves a portion and then gifted the rest to OpenCoin (now Ripple). I don’t know why it was done that way.	haydentiff	1	0	1528488202	1005178490268930048	https://twitter.com/haydentiff/status/1005178490268930048

bitcoin ripple 	Well, a lot of the infrastructure that Ripple/ILP are providing can be used for Bitcoin as well. XRP will have to compete with every other digital asset. I think that’s a good thing for both Bitcoin and XRP. I see them as complementary and not competitive.	haydentiff	11	3	1528456198	1005044259232407552	https://twitter.com/haydentiff/status/1005044259232407552			
	I think regulatory uncertainty could *possibly* be holding things back, but I’m not sure FI’s want to go any faster. It will probably take a few small & hungry payment/remittance providers to light a fire under everyone’s ass. That’s my guess, anyway.	haydentiff	15	1	1528455528	1005041446674751489	https://twitter.com/haydentiff/status/1005041446674751489

ripple 	XRP has a different goal than other crypto. It’s always been this way. Personally, I don’t want to see it airdropped, where it will most likely only be used for speculation. I want to see XRP become a global settlement asset. Ripple has it on the right trajectory.	haydentiff	47	11	1528454226	1005035985946710017	https://twitter.com/haydentiff/status/1005035985946710017

	Don’t take what mainstream articles say at face value, especially when they says “xx will change the world”. “In some cases, DLT can enhance & secure business processes” is a more accurate headline. And don’t get me wrong, I support DLT & the decentralization trend.	sbmeunier	4	0	1528463707	1005075751929024512	https://twitter.com/sbmeunier/status/1005075751929024512

	It is only a matter of governance & design. In my standard supply chain app I could use a central transparent, immutable, secure database. Transparency is not a good argument.	sbmeunier	2	0	1528463467	1005074744037838848	https://twitter.com/sbmeunier/status/1005074744037838848			
	What is not clear is the benefit of having a semi-decentralized system Vs a central system. For supply chain, if you want everyone to use the same system, you could have a standard mobile/web/desktop app in which all the participants update their status!	sbmeunier	1	0	1528463103	1005073217638322181	https://twitter.com/sbmeunier/status/1005073217638322181			
	No offense but outside cryptocurrencies it is not clear yet if blockchain has any use (probably a few actual P2P use cases). I mean in enterprise/B2C context, *blockchain* rather *DLT* = a slow replicated database with cryptography, bringing incremental improvement.	sbmeunier	23	2	1528462487	1005070635352117251	https://twitter.com/sbmeunier/status/1005070635352117251

	Ok, you realize the double spend may never reach your monitors, so we agree it's all risk management coupled with some # yolo.	el33th4xor	7	0	1528492500	1005196520386453504	https://twitter.com/el33th4xor/status/1005196520386453504		#	
	It's not the fee amount that matters, it's the differential treatment tx's receive in the network depending on their fees and on relay thresholds. Nodes (including miners) might very well not even detect that there's a double spend going on.	el33th4xor	8	0	1528491974	1005194315126263808	https://twitter.com/el33th4xor/status/1005194315126263808			
	When the network uses different thresholds for relaying tx's, it's a problem. And since 0-fees can lead to attacks, they can lead to different relay fee thresholds.	el33th4xor	5	0	1528491347	1005191681547923458	https://twitter.com/el33th4xor/status/1005191681547923458			
	0-fee tx's will interfere with 0-conf transactions. If miners accept 0-fee tx's, then people can launch flooding attacks at 0 cost. To defend against this, some nodes can set a higher fee threshold. But now, some nodes may not see 0-fee tx's while other miners mine them.	el33th4xor	4	0	1528491119	1005190724990758912	https://twitter.com/el33th4xor/status/1005190724990758912

	The key change in CB-issued digital fiat is not that it's digital per se but that everyone, not just banks, can get an account with the CB. It disintermediates commercial banks -why it's a big deal and why it will happen in phased way. (Big corporates first, regular Joes last).	mikejcasey	1	0	1528434087	1004951516191567872	https://twitter.com/mikejcasey/status/1004951516191567872			
	Monetary policy officials were never as in-sync with commercial banks as the conspiracy theorists suggest. But CBs' bank supervisors (with commercial job prospects) find it hard to envisage a financial system without banks. Which of each group has most power in each CB matters.	mikejcasey	0	0	1528416753	1004878811945676800	https://twitter.com/mikejcasey/status/1004878811945676800			
	Banks will eventually die or morph into fiduciary risk/asset managers, essentially inseparable from mutual funds. Their role as intermediaries in payments and transactional stores of value will be redundant. The transition to that world is difficult.

bitcoin 	Yep. And *I think* I agree that bitcoin wins in the end -- if not as the actual unit of account, but as the base store of value into which all other transactions are eventually, in some way or another, settled. But I get nervous being as specific as that.	mikejcasey	4	0	1528414916	1004871107369996289	https://twitter.com/mikejcasey/status/1004871107369996289			
	In the end, decentralized cryptocurrencies will win. But before then, perhaps we'll have an interim period in which central banks issue their own digital fiat currencies, ever more widely -- eventually to everyone. That will be world-changing.

	Ironically, the water they poured on the reactor fire almost made things catastrophically worse. It pooled beneath the reactor floor and threatened to cause a truly massive explosion if the core had melted through. Eventually it was drained off, at further cost in lives.	prchovanec	7	3	1528487214	1005174348523679744	https://twitter.com/prchovanec/status/1005174348523679744

	Anyway, I learned a lot from just going there and holding a Geiger counter through the whole experience. And if I glow when I turn out the lights tonight, I’ll let you know.	prchovanec	72	3	1528482518	1005154652982251522	https://twitter.com/prchovanec/status/1005154652982251522			
	But if you lived there day in and day out, it’d be a problem. And if you drank some of the contaminated water in that well, you’d be toast.	prchovanec	20	3	1528482433	1005154294436417536	https://twitter.com/prchovanec/status/1005154294436417536			
	Based on my readings, I probably got the equivalent of one dental x-ray during my trip to Chernobyl today, which is probably a bit less than I got on my flights yesterday from New York to Kiev.	prchovanec	23	6	1528482338	1005153896040411137	https://twitter.com/prchovanec/status/1005153896040411137			
	That rarely happens, if you’re careful and don’t roll around on the ground or anything stupid. But I wore old clothes that I had holes and such that I planned to throw out anyway, just in case.	prchovanec	17	2	1528482227	1005153429839368192	https://twitter.com/prchovanec/status/1005153429839368192			
	Which is why you got through two radiation meters - kind of like fancy airport security gates - on your way out. And if you’ve got contamination on your clothes, they’ve got to either clean it or throw it out.	prchovanec	18	4	1528482139	1005153062275698689	https://twitter.com/prchovanec/status/1005153062275698689			
	So (at least these days) it isn’t really a huge problem visiting Chernobyl and walking past “hot spots” of radiation for a few seconds. It would be living there and being exposed to such levels day in and day out. Or ingesting something or taking it home with you on your clothes.	prchovanec	23	3	1528482052	1005152697102635008	https://twitter.com/prchovanec/status/1005152697102635008			
	But taking that picture only took about 10 seconds, and even just a few feet away the radiation went down dramatically to 1 uSv/hr.	prchovanec	14	2	1528481817	1005151713031000064	https://twitter.com/prchovanec/status/1005151713031000064			
	And if you move your counter right up to a certain spot on this Ferris wheel compartment, it goes up to nearly 400 uSv/hr. That’s almost one dental X-ray every two minutes.pic.twitter.com/QYwVoil4Qe	prchovanec	19	6	1528481768	1005151504486019072	https://twitter.com/prchovanec/status/1005151504486019072			
	But look at this well, in the center of Pripyat: 56 uSv/hr, a dental X-ray every 15 minutes if you stick around. And if you drank from it ... big trouble.pic.twitter.com/fJK29YfWlJ	prchovanec	29	5	1528481491	1005150344907837442	https://twitter.com/prchovanec/status/1005150344907837442			
	The typical reading in the abandoned city of Pripyat itself is about 1-2 uSv/hr.pic.twitter.com/gtl9RgQguR	prchovanec	17	3	1528481319	1005149622543749121	https://twitter.com/prchovanec/status/1005149622543749121			
	But just a few feet away, it leapt to almost 9 uSv/hr. Everything on the far side of the railroad tracks is really contaminated. Standing here is equivalent to a dental X-ray every two hours.pic.twitter.com/Z0SO7w7qlC	prchovanec	22	5	1528481202	1005149130375737345	https://twitter.com/prchovanec/status/1005149130375737345			
	Radiation can really vary a lot depending on just a few feet. Here, at the old entrance sign to the abandoned city of Pripyat, the reading was 0.9 uSv/hr.pic.twitter.com/yGRUjzfIYk	prchovanec	16	3	1528481054	1005148511862775809	https://twitter.com/prchovanec/status/1005148511862775809			
	Also, the wind was blowing in the other direction. When our bus drive past on the other side (pictured), even inside the bus it spiked to 9 or 10 uSv/hr for a few seconds.pic.twitter.com/xS1WBjBDmi	prchovanec	18	7	1528480871	1005147745622032385	https://twitter.com/prchovanec/status/1005147745622032385			
	That’s still about one dental x-ray per day for anyone working there unprotected. And if you went inside that containment dome - well, nobody can, they only use robots inside because it’s off the charts.pic.twitter.com/OyOSkrYpid	prchovanec	25	10	1528480734	1005147168699834368	https://twitter.com/prchovanec/status/1005147168699834368			
	Directly outside the #4 reactor the reading was a fairly moderate 1.2 uSv/hr. It used to be 3 or higher here until they built the new stainless steel arched containment unit about a year ago - quite a major engineering project.pic.twitter.com/RWWck5PqU7	prchovanec	38	16	1528480540	1005146355285876736	https://twitter.com/prchovanec/status/1005146355285876736		#4	
	As you approach the Chernobyl reactor, the average outdoor reading is around 1.3 uSv/hr. That’s about 10x normal background radiation, but less than you’re typically getting at 30,000 feet in airliner.pic.twitter.com/vcy65pgoCs	prchovanec	25	11	1528480370	1005145643277586432	https://twitter.com/prchovanec/status/1005145643277586432			
	So how worrying is 5 uSv/hr? Well, if you stood there for 3 hours, you’d get the equivalent of a dental x-ray. I stood there for about 10 seconds. At 2 uSv/hr, you’d be getting about 3 dental x-rays a day - which is why nobody can live there.pic.twitter.com/wJwPRDQLs2	prchovanec	25	7	1528480041	1005144263200567297	https://twitter.com/prchovanec/status/1005144263200567297			
	That’s more than 15-20x typical background radiation, which sounds awful, but it’s basically the same as you get while flying at 30,000+ feet in a commercial aircraft. However, if you put it down to the ground in certain places, it went up to 5 or higher.pic.twitter.com/I0cJn0ffek	prchovanec	28	8	1528479452	1005141793611177984	https://twitter.com/prchovanec/status/1005141793611177984			
	After we passed the 10km checkpoint we soon reached our first “hot zone” - the garden of an abandoned school. The typical reading, once you walked on the path towards the school, was 2.0 uSv/hr.pic.twitter.com/p5I4lkNEP2	prchovanec	23	7	1528479228	1005140852132507650	https://twitter.com/prchovanec/status/1005140852132507650			
	The zone from 30km to 10km away from the Chernobyl reactor can still be inhabited, but only by temporary containment workers living in barracks and locals age 55 or older (i.e., above child-bearing years) who have chosen to return. The reading there stayed around 0.20 uSv/hr.pic.twitter.com/fzo3sM0C9U	prchovanec	22	10	1528479079	1005140225839034368	https://twitter.com/prchovanec/status/1005140225839034368			
	At the start of the trip, I received my personal handheld Geiger counter. The typical background radiation in a city like Kiev, and at the entrance to the Chernobyl exclusion zone, is about 0.10 to 0.15 microsieverts (uSv) per hour.pic.twitter.com/vcjGp9ZG7y	prchovanec	23	7	1528478778	1005138963282227201	https://twitter.com/prchovanec/status/1005138963282227201
