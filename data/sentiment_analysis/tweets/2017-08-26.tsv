	False. This is just self-aggrandizement. If you look calmly, you'll note that cryptos have been accepted by the biggest economic powers.	el33th4xor	11	0	1503777934	901536117702483969	https://twitter.com/el33th4xor/status/901536117702483969

	A late-dev should have around an average number of coins. W/o a premine, no reason why they should be tightly wedded to the success of coin.	el33th4xor	4	0	1503758972	901456583204499456	https://twitter.com/el33th4xor/status/901456583204499456			
	Depends. Speaking generally, not just BTC: Were they there for the pre-mine? Did they lose their coins on an exchange hack?	el33th4xor	3	0	1503758819	901455942813929474	https://twitter.com/el33th4xor/status/901455942813929474			
	Excellent question. Anyone who figures out how to do so will have the next big coin. I suspect it can't be done purely algorithmically.	el33th4xor	2	0	1503757455	901450221846179840	https://twitter.com/el33th4xor/status/901450221846179840

	Ideally, people would evaluate proposals from a scientific perspective instead of acting tribally, but that's too much to hope for.	el33th4xor	36	2	1503757145	901448921653927937	https://twitter.com/el33th4xor/status/901448921653927937			
	So cast your lot accordingly.	el33th4xor	7	0	1503757105	901448753445515264	https://twitter.com/el33th4xor/status/901448753445515264			
	In terms of security:miners have 100m+ committed, businesses 10m+, VCs billions+ collectively. Devs rage-quit and walk away all the time.	el33th4xor	78	17	1503757000	901448314108989441	https://twitter.com/el33th4xor/status/901448314108989441			
	Miners hold coins, businesses want fast turnover. Devs have complex games they play that have nothing to do with either.	el33th4xor	50	9	1503756909	901447932179828737	https://twitter.com/el33th4xor/status/901447932179828737			
	If you believe the system will gain value by expanding community, you are aligned with those who want more coin turnover. Not devs.	el33th4xor	30	1	1503756853	901447696942288896	https://twitter.com/el33th4xor/status/901447696942288896			
bitcoin 	As for Bitcoin: if you hold coins, your interests are aligned with those who hold coins. That's not devs.	el33th4xor	55	12	1503756747	901447251582701569	https://twitter.com/el33th4xor/status/901447251582701569			
	These motivations are short-term and self-limiting. They drive away new devs from entering the space and strangle the project.	el33th4xor	20	1	1503756643	901446816343969792	https://twitter.com/el33th4xor/status/901446816343969792			
	The best example for this is Asterisk. An OSS project so complex, no one can do anything other than what's explicit in the tutorials.	el33th4xor	32	4	1503756550	901446425548083200	https://twitter.com/el33th4xor/status/901446425548083200			
	This guarantees a consulting stream. You want to add a tweak? Well, you can't, you need to hire someone who understands the mess.	el33th4xor	30	4	1503756498	901446208689975296	https://twitter.com/el33th4xor/status/901446208689975296			
	A complex OSS project immediately makes them an expert because they know all its warts. That's because they put them there.	el33th4xor	36	5	1503756436	901445945551990785	https://twitter.com/el33th4xor/status/901445945551990785			
	The devs are typically uncredentialed, young people with few other accomplishments and job prospects.	el33th4xor	23	3	1503756396	901445778220224513	https://twitter.com/el33th4xor/status/901445778220224513			
	The second reason is to make themselves indispensable, by increasing the complexity of the OSS project.	el33th4xor	36	3	1503756355	901445605796397056	https://twitter.com/el33th4xor/status/901445605796397056			
	An example is systemd, where Poettering is trying to import into Linux all of Windows' problems.	el33th4xor	57	20	1503756319	901445456689061888	https://twitter.com/el33th4xor/status/901445456689061888			
	This means that projects often evolve into totally different beasts, by force of pure ego.	el33th4xor	25	4	1503756263	901445223422865408	https://twitter.com/el33th4xor/status/901445223422865408			
	One reason is to simply leave their unique mark. How else would anyone know that they are good if there isn't a unique new vision?	el33th4xor	31	2	1503756189	901444910355816448	https://twitter.com/el33th4xor/status/901444910355816448			
	In general, OSS devs, esp. second gen devs, have an interest in making project more complex, for two reasons.	el33th4xor	26	11	1503756136	901444690129670145	https://twitter.com/el33th4xor/status/901444690129670145			
	The result, if it is to be believed, is interesting: people think dev interests are aligned, even though they absolutely are not.https://twitter.com/alistairmilne/status/901427587792211968 …	el33th4xor	44	11	1503756074	901444430225395712	https://twitter.com/el33th4xor/status/901444430225395712			
	Just do the math, taking into account that the attacker has to protect his own chain.	el33th4xor	5	2	1503755805	901443300711968768	https://twitter.com/el33th4xor/status/901443300711968768			
	Ok, you're wasting my time and contribute nothing of substance. Blocked, best of luck in life.	el33th4xor	0	0	1503755579	901442353508036608	https://twitter.com/el33th4xor/status/901442353508036608			
	That's incorrect. I don't have time today, but ask yourself why we don't see such attacks. It's not because everyone is playing nice. :-)	el33th4xor	6	2	1503755372	901441483617775616	https://twitter.com/el33th4xor/status/901441483617775616			
	If you cannot discuss a topic without making it personal or attacking the messenger, I'll conclude you're an idiot or malicious and block.	el33th4xor	3	0	1503754962	901439762749435907	https://twitter.com/el33th4xor/status/901439762749435907

bitcoin 	The Bitcoin discussion is getting ugly. Trolls don't cut it anymore, so real people are leaking emails and threatening each other.https://twitter.com/eric_lombrozo/status/901208773334716417 …	el33th4xor	33	8	1503752643	901430038188503041	https://twitter.com/el33th4xor/status/901430038188503041

bitcoin 	What a terrible worldview. Is Bitcoin an attack on other currencies? If you don't innovate, can you tell others not to? https://twitter.com/SatoshiLite/status/901122973804879873 …	el33th4xor	128	31	1503748462	901412502738784257	https://twitter.com/el33th4xor/status/901412502738784257
