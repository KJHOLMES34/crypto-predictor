	"Positive/normative conflation is one of the most popular logical fallacies; it should really be listed in textbooks right up there with ""affirming the consequent"".

	For example, if someone denies the facts of the Terrible Blue Eyed People Genocide of 1902+3i, it's reasonable to block them from history conferences, but less reasonable to drive them out of their tech job.

	One is about censoring viewpoints in contexts where the viewpoint is incidental and unrelated to what they're being ostracized *from*, the other is not giving speaking slots to people who have misled people in those very same speaking slots.

	Oh I agree that's a concern. But blacklisting people who believe women are on average less interested in compsci than men for partly genetic reasons, and blacklisting scammers, are very different; I don't even think the drives to do each one are that connected.

ethereum 	This is a chart of ethereum hashrate divided by 100-day EMA of dollar value of block rewards paid. (100-day EMA because price changes take time to propagate to hashrate due to hardware sunk costs) We're still well within historical norms.pic.twitter.com/LURYuloLKz	VitalikButerin	743	210	1523244111	983183179539398658	https://twitter.com/VitalikButerin/status/983183179539398658

bitcoin 	It's going to force Indians to treat bitcoin as a payment network and foreign currency, to see it as income for work, rather than a speculative investment.

	Nvidia sell general purpose GPUs which are not built or optimized specifically for mining. They also sell subset of those GPUs with video output disabled.

	I'm not saying that 30% is the end of the world... I'm simply saying mining pools are a *form* of centralization.

	"(5) These same 6 months will come again - NO ONE can tell you when - no media, no press, no expert, no one. period (except for me of course ;-).

	(4) BUT, I met 100s of people, including myself, who've made millions in crypto, simply by doing the dead-boring thing and NOT following the daily ups and downs, but just HODLing. I have been in crypto for over 4 yrs now, and I made 90% of my money in less than 6 months of that.	julianhosp	77	14	1523227494	983113484605915141	https://twitter.com/julianhosp/status/983113484605915141			
	(3) So what does that mean? People ask me every day, how to make money in crypto. Here is how: You are either marvelous at timing the market (VERY VERY unlikely) or you just HODL. I personally have not met anyone that can undoubtly show that he/she made money trading.	julianhosp	49	8	1523227494	983113482823331841	https://twitter.com/julianhosp/status/983113482823331841			
	(2) These 10 days happened either during strong bull phases or right after massive setbacks. Both times, when it is unlikely that people who think they can time the market, will be in the market. They are probably scared during these days (too much up or down).	julianhosp	32	6	1523227493	983113481170796544	https://twitter.com/julianhosp/status/983113481170796544			
	"(1) Lets lay out some facts: If from 2013-2018 you would have missed the strongest 10 days in BTC, you would have ""only"" made 51% / yr compared to 131% / yr.
