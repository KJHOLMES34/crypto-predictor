	If BitMain (or other mine manufacturers) wants to stay competitive, they need overt AsicBoost. But they must join BDPL to use it.

bitcoin 	Backstory: BitMain has used their patents to sue others. They allegedly were using AsicBoost covertly to mine Bitcoin and that's why they were so against SegWit. SegWit blocks covert but not overt AsicBoost boost.

bitcoin 	This news went under the radar recently, but I want to highlight this as a HUGE (YUGE!) development in decentralization of Bitcoin mining.

	??? it was my 70% odds target this weekend in update.. I can see VERY clear now that rates once again will cause of next crash leg.. thats EASY.. reason for 2450.. but right now.. currency says WE HAVE NOT TOPPED... so just be patient and wait for clues..https://twitter.com/hmadej1/status/971000452174278656 …	Bamabroker	17	0	1520339711	971001241768726528	https://twitter.com/Bamabroker/status/971001241768726528			
	"I know many will always be upset that his agenda is ""diversity"" 24-7.. because to many that is all that matters... but there is no way to sugar coat this... trump is nuts... he really is.. can't take him serious a second.. but he has done a lot of good.. period.. so far"	Bamabroker	22	2	1520339578	971000687848050688	https://twitter.com/Bamabroker/status/971000687848050688			
	I am not a fan of both sides as most know.. but if your still bashing trump.. after tax cuts to all... higher GDP and higher stock markets.. and now North Korea talking about de-armimg.. the worlds biggest risk... your now starting to sound like a crazy person...https://twitter.com/WSJ/status/970997847733784576 …	Bamabroker	58	14	1520339475	971000255293677568	https://twitter.com/Bamabroker/status/971000255293677568			
	Once again... expected a BIG SPX pop.. but this one is coming with higher rates and dollar destroyed.. which only leave ONE path after this... SPX destroyed.. next major crash leg is close.. dollar rallies and rates drop as a result.. The move up is a negative feed back loop	Bamabroker	73	14	1520339310	970999559827738630	https://twitter.com/Bamabroker/status/970999559827738630

	Yep.. VOL is collapsing.. people are sick of this garbage,... been that way since August 2016 now.. also a sign we have washed out a lot of GDX perma bulls also.. smells like a PUKE and major rally might be about right soon.. https://twitter.com/chartchimp/status/970876312888819712 …	Bamabroker	14	1	1520310075	970876941417971712	https://twitter.com/Bamabroker/status/970876941417971712

	I think GOLD is going to see 1300 in a week or so.. and that could be the low... GDX may see 20.. and be done... we could be getting close to a major rally in GDX.. not yet.. but I can very clearly see the signs turning soon..

	very high odds if OIL is up in AM.. start that short back... I do think OIL will turn before SPX... these two are the same now.. just liquidity trades... nothing else.. but I think SPX gets defended from above some... no one cares about oil.. so it gives you an early clue here..

	still thinking natty breaks up ... clear 2.75 and we should soon.. and 2.90 comes quick.. after being this tame.. we are about to get a 10-15% 2 day move.. hope its up and not down..	Bamabroker	19	2	1520309337	970873846663434240	https://twitter.com/Bamabroker/status/970873846663434240			
	I still think its possible we hit 2800 before we head to 2450 as laid out... but we are now to a place that can fail.. and a move in AM to 2750... would setup a failure ASAP... and a 300 point spike down on tap.. heads up..

	I plan on dumping my IBB calls in AM... up huge... and. hoping for a small pop in AM.. to get out... risk is rising.. now on SPX.. we do NOT have ANY sign of a turn.. in fact currency land says we may go more up Tuesday to start.. but at ANY TIME.. this could change..

	What's worse is they blame the banks for all the money they stole for social programs. Cut them off.
