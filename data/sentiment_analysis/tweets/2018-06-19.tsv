	Exactly my point. We cannot assume that incumbents won’t react or are unable to. We should assume that they will until we find an equilibrium point.	VinnyLingham	1	0	1529439543	1009168704360218625	https://twitter.com/VinnyLingham/status/1009168704360218625

bitcoin 	I've written about this previously, but the conclusion I reached was that governments would be forced to NOT print fiat or risk devaluation of their currency against Bitcoin. What Bitcoiners don't want to accept is that it's not an all or nothing outcome or downward spiral.

	Money is backed by the underlying economies that it serves. I agree that governments have too much power over fiat creation, but the system has a feedback loop.

	Because. although the GDP of the world is measured in USD, it's a relative number. The world GDP is NOT $78trn in USD, it's as a relative unit of account across the rest of the world. Those countries don't convert their currencies into USD when the calculation is done.	VinnyLingham	0	0	1529436763	1009157046610980864	https://twitter.com/VinnyLingham/status/1009157046610980864

	Hey @ AlexLielacher, why would you rely *exclusively* on one belligerent group pushing a non-tech reviewed paper for your reporting, on a topic that attracts crackpots?

	It has been five years, countless amount of peer-review on SM, and still, the weakest minds try to attack it. Always with some broken math. Sometimes plagiarized.

	Interesting in-depth analysis of how dPoS goes wrong. Recall that the d in dPoS is only necessary because traditional consensus protocols used with PoS don't scale, and therefore delegation is necessary. That, of course, brings in all the problems.https://cryptogo.de/en/lisk-the-mafia-blockchain/ …	el33th4xor	114	51	1529419772	1009085778696331264	https://twitter.com/el33th4xor/status/1009085778696331264

	As a journalist, I couldn't help it -- articles like cover stories take months to report. 45 minutes on something someone (sometime me) spent months of their life on is actually much more rewarding than articles that are shorter.

	Let’s agree on a more general proposition: Digital bearer instruments exchanged between counterparties using a shared ledger (or, in @ iang_fc language, triple entry accounting) would create more efficient, and potentially more transparent, financial markets.	dgwbirch	2	1	1529406572	1009030415213105152	https://twitter.com/dgwbirch/status/1009030415213105152			@

	Of course the people in Guantanamo Bay (and the other CIA black sites etc) aren't cute children, and mothers. They're scary bearded fundamentalists. But some of them are innocent.

	This is what happens when you don't close Guantanamo Bay, and maybe prosecute some people for setting it up. Guantanamo is still open. People are still being held without trial.

	In many ways, empires survive by winnowing down the number of fights they actually have to fight, or by ensuring - in advance - that they are lopsided in their favor.	prchovanec	3	1	1529416488	1009072004979478528	https://twitter.com/prchovanec/status/1009072004979478528

	We’re going to disagree on the nature of empires. If most empires had to rely primarily on military might as their main hold on power, they’d collapse quickly.

	Same goes for historical analogies. I can say “this reminds me of (some aspect of) the English Civil War” without saying “we’re basically reliving the English Civil War”, and still acknowledging huge differences between our situation and the English Civil War.	prchovanec	6	0	1529413038	1009057535926657024	https://twitter.com/prchovanec/status/1009057535926657024			
	Because as I’ve remarked before, many people don’t seem to understand that the value of analogy lies in finding revealing similarities in DISsimilar things, not equating two things as identical in all or even most respects.	prchovanec	8	1	1529412780	1009056455159316483	https://twitter.com/prchovanec/status/1009056455159316483			
	When I think it is valid, I usually try to compare something with a specific psychology, practice, or political dynamic in the Nazi era that should alert us to substantive parallels. I will admit, though, this is usually lost on most people.	prchovanec	3	1	1529412537	1009055433615642624	https://twitter.com/prchovanec/status/1009055433615642624			
	The Nazi period is both a “warning from history” and an emotion-fraught label that can be easily abused.	prchovanec	5	2	1529412277	1009054341809033217	https://twitter.com/prchovanec/status/1009054341809033217			
	But drawing too direct and bright a line from everything problematic or objectionable to the very worst Nazi atrocities also courts gross exaggeration, undermining the credibility of the real argument.	prchovanec	14	0	1529412132	1009053733500710912	https://twitter.com/prchovanec/status/1009053733500710912			
	It is important to learn the lessons of the Nazi period, and to recognize parallels when we see them. Otherwise, it is all too easy to end up in an “unthinkable” place without realizing how you got there.	prchovanec	8	1	1529411977	1009053083643629568	https://twitter.com/prchovanec/status/1009053083643629568

	Because every protectionist step we take confirms them in the view they were right all along, and free trade was always a bridge we were trying to sell them.	prchovanec	4	0	1529408028	1009036521696059393	https://twitter.com/prchovanec/status/1009036521696059393
