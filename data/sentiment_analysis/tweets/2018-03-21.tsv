	I think, perhaps counter-intuitively, that is is healthier that you, as a self-professed centralised service (albeit one that can be auto-routed around) aim to make a profit to encourage people to route around you. and increase fees if that does not happen over time.	adam3us	5	0	1521619531	976369198413709312	https://twitter.com/adam3us/status/976369198413709312			
	you could consider communicating your intent to have others route around you by charging a non-zero fee (at some multiple of min fee) leaving scope for others to undercut you and retain a profit (ie without matching zero.) otherwise free is difficult competition.	adam3us	21	2	1521601012	976291522445434880	https://twitter.com/adam3us/status/976291522445434880

	Actually, it's not so bad. As in, it's not the end of the game and there are still meaningful guarantees even in such a world. But yes, they would require a rethink of the core protocol.	el33th4xor	3	1	1521670362	976582399923572737	https://twitter.com/el33th4xor/status/976582399923572737			
	That's true and it'd be a terrible extreme-case outcome. But I suspect there'll always be plenty of nodes that validate all of the chain, minus some well agreed ranges that they want to elide.	el33th4xor	2	0	1521670241	976581892505038849	https://twitter.com/el33th4xor/status/976581892505038849			
	This isn't a general rewriting mechanism. It preserves semantics. And it should, for the very reason you mentioned!	el33th4xor	0	0	1521669751	976579835723214848	https://twitter.com/el33th4xor/status/976579835723214848			
	But at this point, I am not worried that states will crack down on the entire area of blockchains because of a few, or actually, just one according to the study, instance of vile material.	el33th4xor	0	0	1521667225	976569241137803265	https://twitter.com/el33th4xor/status/976569241137803265			
bitcoin 	I don't think these pose any greater threat with blockchains than they do with any other medium. If anything, a viral leak on Twitter becomes undeleteable, and visible, much faster than on Bitcoin. Your previous point stands though: sovereigns could use such data as a pretext.	el33th4xor	3	0	1521667088	976568664848764929	https://twitter.com/el33th4xor/status/976568664848764929			
	This would be a terrible outcome, but see my (crossed) message on channel capacity:https://twitter.com/el33th4xor/status/976566567906566145?s=19 …	el33th4xor	1	0	1521666665	976566894236000256	https://twitter.com/el33th4xor/status/976566894236000256			
	And lastly, channel capacity matters a lot in steganography. A channel that requires millions of transactions to encode an image, costing tens of thousands of dollars, is interesting to ponder intellectually, but not a realistic threat on our way of life.	el33th4xor	2	0	1521666588	976566567906566145	https://twitter.com/el33th4xor/status/976566567906566145			
	There's also the legal issue of whether the Section 230 exemption should apply to nodes in a peer to peer system. There are many arguments and counterarguments, so I won't touch that one right now, but it's not a settled question that storing bits without a decoder is possession.	el33th4xor	2	1	1521666361	976565617322086401	https://twitter.com/el33th4xor/status/976565617322086401			
bitcoin 	"Ok, your argument comes down to ""it will always be possible for a user to determine the side effects/meta-data, and ergo, they can always encode something on a chain whose removal is problematic."" This is true for Bitcoin, but there's no impossibility result backing it."	el33th4xor	1	0	1521666190	976564901006204928	https://twitter.com/el33th4xor/status/976564901006204928			
	"If your point is ""it will always be possible to encode steg messages on any storage medium,"" we agree, see the first message in thread. If you are worried that blockchains will be commandeered to transmit vile images on a scale to cause societal problems, we disagree."	el33th4xor	5	0	1521665090	976560287091478528	https://twitter.com/el33th4xor/status/976560287091478528			
	Not quite: https://twitter.com/el33th4xor/status/976544202367684609?s=19 … If you download from the most recent block backwards, you can skip downloading any data whose hash and side effects you know.	el33th4xor	10	0	1521664079	976556045240881152	https://twitter.com/el33th4xor/status/976556045240881152			
	Indeed, it will come down to arguing over possession -- whether you can receive a message for which you have no decoder. It's pretty clear what I think.	el33th4xor	1	0	1521663834	976555018089361409	https://twitter.com/el33th4xor/status/976555018089361409			
	Indeed, that's why Communications Decency Act has a section (230) dedicated to service providers who do run nodes on the Internet, exempting them from responsibility. Peer-to-peer services complicate the legal wording, so expect much wrangling.	el33th4xor	4	1	1521663201	976552364118298628	https://twitter.com/el33th4xor/status/976552364118298628			
	I'm not a lawyer, but I know how I can configure my node to not download/upload unwanted ranges of the chain. If there's no content transmitted, there is no basis for any legal concern.	el33th4xor	2	0	1521662373	976548889745600514	https://twitter.com/el33th4xor/status/976548889745600514			
	By is validated, I mean encoded in a block and deeply confirmed. Erasing info in S (a la mastercoin) is complicated, as I mentioned at the top of the thread -- the truck will require having multiple encodings and moving data into params not chosen by the user.	el33th4xor	1	0	1521662155	976547974925955077	https://twitter.com/el33th4xor/status/976547974925955077			
	The chain has a transaction that summarizes a range R with hash H as having side effects S. Once the transaction is validated, the byte range can be dropped. Whether the chain becomes unverifiable-from-origin depends on whether any nodes retain R.	el33th4xor	0	0	1521661925	976547012341530624	https://twitter.com/el33th4xor/status/976547012341530624			
	That just leaves the legal aspects of this hot-button issue. I'm sure the lawyers will chime in and discuss ad nauseum. I wouldn't be surprised if the letter of the law, written for centralized service providers, may need to be changed when it comes to peer-to-peer services.	el33th4xor	28	4	1521661456	976545046056128517	https://twitter.com/el33th4xor/status/976545046056128517			
	Technically, it's actually easy to agree to excise unwanted parts of a blockchain. Nodes can store the hash and side effects of a transaction, without its content.	el33th4xor	25	5	1521661255	976544202367684609	https://twitter.com/el33th4xor/status/976544202367684609			
	So the worry that there may be unwanted content in the blockchain poses no ethical quandary. I worry about it as much as I worry about receiving an email that has, embedded in the low bits, a vile image that I can't see. It can happen. We have 0 moral culpability if it does.	el33th4xor	59	9	1521661183	976543900235190272	https://twitter.com/el33th4xor/status/976543900235190272			
	In the same way that there may be a book in my library with a hidden message in it, spelled out by the the first letter of every line, except I have no idea it exists because I have no idea how to extract it, any data transmission might be carrying a message I have no idea exists	el33th4xor	34	6	1521660814	976542349710057472	https://twitter.com/el33th4xor/status/976542349710057472			
	"But ""receiving"" data requires having the decoder that can reconstitute the original content from the specific encoding in the chain. And regular cryptocurrency software lacks such a decoder."	el33th4xor	23	3	1521660704	976541888110002178	https://twitter.com/el33th4xor/status/976541888110002178			
	People can store such content in the straightforward manner in the opaque data field, but they can also get creative and store it in the addresses chosen as destinations, for instance. Such data plays a critical role in facilitating second layer apps built on top of the chain.	el33th4xor	21	3	1521660577	976541355643195393	https://twitter.com/el33th4xor/status/976541355643195393

	The encoding used for such messages is as diverse as human creativity. It is nonsensical to expect that an entity, any entity, detect and ban such messages. It's just not possible.	el33th4xor	31	7	1521660164	976539623907356677	https://twitter.com/el33th4xor/status/976539623907356677			
	Acrostics have been around for hundreds of years, and there's an entire field, steganography, dedicated to hiding such messages.	el33th4xor	34	5	1521660061	976539191889809408	https://twitter.com/el33th4xor/status/976539191889809408			
	Likewise, a publisher can arrange the first letter of every line to spell out a hidden message in a book, and a record player backwards at the right speed can contain secret messages.	el33th4xor	30	6	1521659978	976538843980681216	https://twitter.com/el33th4xor/status/976538843980681216			
	"Thread on images on the blockchain: As long as there is user-provided data, systems that store that data can be commandeered to store what is being called ""illegal content.""

	Suppose the chain has a special kind of transaction that says that byte range R has hash H and side effects S. That would obviate the need to download or store R.

	Knowing what has to happen before you can act is a strength. Going first is also a strength. You can't be good at both. The most important strategy of all, the hidden knowledge above price, is self knowledge. You have to know yourself to excel, and to know your world deeply too.	leashless	38	5	1521635666	976436871621431296	https://twitter.com/leashless/status/976436871621431296			
	The really big powers are unwilling to commit until the SEC makes its plans known, and maybe some currency regulators too. We don't touch currency, so we are pretty much moving into tactical. We just need to see the investigations roll out to finalize our responsive position.	leashless	12	6	1521635571	976436473581928448	https://twitter.com/leashless/status/976436473581928448			
	A different kind of people will come to prominence: not the masters of feint and implicit knowledge, but square jawed field commanders with big, efficient machines behind them. The most interesting age of crypto draws to a close. The most impactful age begins. It's a change over	leashless	24	9	1521635447	976435956394921989	https://twitter.com/leashless/status/976435956394921989			
	As things stabilize, strategy becomes less important. Sheer tactical grunt to get through the permutations faster becomes more important. Risk minimizing through pre-existing networks yields more and more results. Things start to be streamlined.	leashless	13	5	1521635359	976435585404588032	https://twitter.com/leashless/status/976435585404588032			
	My prediction is that the secret driven era of crypto is almost over. The regulators have played most of their cards, and the huge WTF moon math cryptography (i.e. ZKSNARKS) are mostly out in the open now. We are approaching stabilization. Things will change.	leashless	31	12	1521635273	976435223998103552	https://twitter.com/leashless/status/976435223998103552			
	So strategies can also be about dealing with other people's secrets. The SEC does not reveal its thinking early. One must model possible outcomes, or refuse to commit resources (say to a token sale) until the secrets are revealed. Those who bet on secret data can win or lose big.	leashless	13	4	1521635182	976434844954693635	https://twitter.com/leashless/status/976434844954693635			
	A more complex strategy was years of regular dinners in which all and sundry across crypto came to my house and talked. What came out of that was models (data compression) and a lexicon (even more DC) to accelerate our thinking. We know how to think about our area better.	leashless	15	3	1521635081	976434419790696448	https://twitter.com/leashless/status/976434419790696448			
	So let's think about crypto. My strategy has been to use my hidden knowledge (years in the field) to design a company @ mattereum that ought to prosper whether crypto regulators are harsh or relaxed. Either way, smart contracts and law are here to stay. This is a simple strategy.	leashless	21	6	1521634804	976433255967752197	https://twitter.com/leashless/status/976433255967752197			@
	"So back to strategy. Strategy compresses computation. It's heuristic, and sometimes algorithmic. Or it builds around hidden knowledge to do otherwise-impossible things. ""Knowing how to use your secrets for maximum impact"" is a good way to essentialize strategy."	leashless	21	4	1521634667	976432683092979712	https://twitter.com/leashless/status/976432683092979712			
	"Experience aids strategy. ""Regulators bat last"" summarises 20 years of game between tech and government. You don't really need to know more: the crypto economy can't stabilize until the regulators have established and published their positions. THEN the real game begins."	leashless	32	7	1521634540	976432150345117696	https://twitter.com/leashless/status/976432150345117696			
	Philosophy and strategy operate to reduce the work done to get through the mass of options. We can't compute our way through, but we know that a weak centre or empty triangles are bad. When things are the wrong shape or texture, it's aesthetics summarizing computation.	leashless	31	5	1521634299	976431140247654401	https://twitter.com/leashless/status/976431140247654401			
	Even in a game with no hidden pieces, things can be hidden by sheer complexity. Nothing is hidden in chess, there are no aces on top of the deck. It's all right there. The knowledge needed to win is buried under the massive range of possible moves.	leashless	37	10	1521634135	976430453287739392	https://twitter.com/leashless/status/976430453287739392			
	A few reflections on strategy. Strategy comes from knowing things other people do not or cannot know. With identical knowledge, all that's left is a computation of tactical efficiency. Narratives and philosophy are relevant kinds of knowledge. Let me explain why.	leashless	147	44	1521633948	976429669024260099	https://twitter.com/leashless/status/976429669024260099

Two identical charts one w/ $0 cash & $5 bln in debt gets the same reading as a name with $5 bln in cash w/ no debt? Ludicrous.

	My 122-page report to subscribers. Nothing in a chart includes the work I put into that.

In Davos, Beijing talks about how open they are while at industry meetings they talk about how they are going to wreck the Americans and push back etc. It's about messaging which Beijing is good at 4/n	BaldingsWorld	19	5	1521604381	976305653596667904	https://twitter.com/BaldingsWorld/status/976305653596667904			
	Second, Beijing makes official/public information targeting very different populations. What they say at Davos in English and what they say at Chinese language only conferences VERY different. Consequently, the big press events all about who is consuming it 3/n	BaldingsWorld	21	4	1521604244	976305080012914688	https://twitter.com/BaldingsWorld/status/976305080012914688			
	First, in censored/authoritarian state, words are very weak signals. Everybody says very bland things or says nothing at all. Beijing says things at Davos that are just patently absurd about how open it is or how it is the worlds largest democracy. In China, words mean little 2/n	BaldingsWorld	25	6	1521604143	976304656983900162	https://twitter.com/BaldingsWorld/status/976304656983900162

	This is very important when we have these debates about Chinese influence abroad. Beijing absolutely clearly calling on all ethnic Chinese, exerting pressure at home and abroad on ethnic Chinese then playing the victim.
