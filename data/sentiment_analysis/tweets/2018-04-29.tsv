bitcoin 	Buffett says buying Bitcoin is 'not investing' because you couldn't do it on a private basis, always need a 'greater fool'. I disagree: a farmer still relies on others buying his products, it's just that he sells into mature markets.

It then shows how many days that entity would need to roll back Bitcoin's from the genesis block. Indeed, wouldn't hold with recent blocks."
