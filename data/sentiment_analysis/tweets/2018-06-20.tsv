	And how do you program “significant” exactly? (ISIS question) Check the definition: an information is a fact only if real/proven.

	Do you mean that a fact may be inaccurate or untrue?

	Sorry guys. The takeaway might be correct, but the study is crap. Pew Research itself can’t tell the difference!

	Xapo did a lot of consolidation during weekends. They paid 1 sat/byte & spread it out over time so it didn't impact the fees for other users and it was also cheaper for them.

	Bithumb is paying crazy fees to consolidate everything now (assuming it's not the hacker), driving up the overall fees for everyone on the network. Is this a problem? No, not really.

bitcoin 	Lots of exchanges had very bad internal processes and design on how to deal with # Bitcoin and other UTXO based coins.

	4/ I'm also going to try to write short things, in the interest of actually publishing them.

	3/ I'll mostly be writing about crypto stuff, but sometimes more general thoughts about founders, teams, and trends I am seeing in venture capital, and investing.

	8/ The listing will probably mean increased volatility in day(s) leading up to it and following, and is a positive catalyst short term...

	5/ I've heard many times that the reason $ LTC performed so well in 2017 from 2$ to $300+ is because of its @ coinbase add.

	Is there really an off-ramp, or does Trump see a world with high trade barriers as the natural outcome to be embraced? At least some of his advisors believe so, and much of the time he certainly sounds like it.	prchovanec	2	0	1529521638	1009513035034189825	https://twitter.com/prchovanec/status/1009513035034189825			
	Also, trading partners are scratching their head: what is the goal of Trump’s tariffs? Are they really bargaining chips for freer markets, or is industry protection the end goal?	prchovanec	6	1	1529521330	1009511745117937665	https://twitter.com/prchovanec/status/1009511745117937665

	As well as what Chinese retaliatory measures might look like (and no, I'm not talking about selling off U.S. bonds, as I've discussed many times before). But Beijing would see that, somewhat justifiably, as an act of war.	prchovanec	3	0	1529508473	1009457818045427712	https://twitter.com/prchovanec/status/1009457818045427712			
	And yes, as @ DAlexBlumenthal has suggested in the past, the U.S. could try to purposely destabilize China's financial sector via sanctions or whatnot, but as I've said before, I think that requires some serious thinking about what the collateral damage could be, globally.	prchovanec	4	0	1529508386	1009457452385996800	https://twitter.com/prchovanec/status/1009457452385996800			@
	But it's not like the US is going to suddenly take anything away from China that was THE stabilizing factor in their economic equation, and leave them screaming.	prchovanec	7	0	1529508197	1009456662699216897	https://twitter.com/prchovanec/status/1009456662699216897			
	In other words, China's economic imbalances are a lot bigger than any discretionary trade leverage the U.S. can bring against it. They will continue to do what they've been doing, which is batten down the hatches, keep expanding credit, and hope for the best.	prchovanec	6	2	1529507983	1009455765114023938	https://twitter.com/prchovanec/status/1009455765114023938			
	China's economic troubles stem from its reliance on external demand that won't materialize with or without US tariffs. So tariffs, in my view, won't really be a decisive factor in causing them any more grief than they've already wrought for themselves.https://twitter.com/DAlexBlumenthal/status/1009453364353077248 …	prchovanec	17	3	1529507763	1009454838986534912	https://twitter.com/prchovanec/status/1009454838986534912

	The inability to prioritize and pick battles is one of the most disturbing aspects of Trump's approach to trade disputes.

bitcoin 	As said in dec at crypto top. Crypto nerds don't want to hear it but crypto is just a spec liquidity trade on central banks. Nothing else.
