bitcoin 	If GHash.io had successfully 51% attacked bitcoin, its price would NOT have dropped to zero. It would have dropped maybe 90% and the core devs would have stayed up a few nights and made an emergency switch to PoS, at which point the price would have partially recovered.

	> all the right miners (remaining 49%) sh/would reject the transactions? This only protects against attacks that try to finalize invalid blocks. It does nothing against attacks that revert or prevent consensus.	VitalikButerin	3	1	1516653565	955540426366185472	https://twitter.com/VitalikButerin/status/955540426366185472			
	Government attacker? Banks? Speculator on markets? Someone funded by a competing blockchain?	VitalikButerin	6	2	1516653534	955540297311666176	https://twitter.com/VitalikButerin/status/955540297311666176			
	"Hence ""usually"" :)"	VitalikButerin	8	3	1516653390	955539694116225024	https://twitter.com/VitalikButerin/status/955539694116225024			
	See here: https:// twitter.com/VitalikButerin /status/955483702481612800 …	VitalikButerin	3	2	1516653222	955538987132702721	https://twitter.com/VitalikButerin/status/955538987132702721			
	And the adults understand that extreme far ends of tradeoff curves are pretty much always undesirable	VitalikButerin	1	0	1516641946	955491694350405633	https://twitter.com/VitalikButerin/status/955491694350405633			
	So accepting a 1% issuance rate to avoid a 1% chance of attack per year is actually really not that smart a choice to make, at least if your use of a blockchain is for a cryptocurrency to store your value.	VitalikButerin	194	32	1516641141	955488317025419264	https://twitter.com/VitalikButerin/status/955488317025419264			
	Though with long withdrawal times and well-designed gadgets (bonded service providers, insurance markets, etc) they can be quite a good security/cost tradeoff.	VitalikButerin	123	29	1516641038	955487885276385280	https://twitter.com/VitalikButerin/status/955487885276385280			
	Reminder: if a blockchain fails and recovers, you still have all your assets, unless they were in channels and loss of liveness during the attack enabled an attack on the channel. It's not 100% truly fully yours unless it's on-chain; channels are already a security/cost tradeoff.	VitalikButerin	193	51	1516640975	955487619139416064	https://twitter.com/VitalikButerin/status/955487619139416064			
	There are opportunities to improve things with better technology, for example things like https:// ethresear.ch/t/censorship-r ejection-through-suspicion-scores/305 … can do 80% of the work of social coordination automatically, making it easier to use against attacks and harder to abuse for other ends.	VitalikButerin	103	36	1516640826	955486995844947968	https://twitter.com/VitalikButerin/status/955486995844947968			
	After all, minimizing use of the social layer *is* what blockchains are about. But reducing it to zero has infinite cost, and so there are real tradeoffs between minimizing the social layer and minimizing cost.	VitalikButerin	159	32	1516640680	955486382004342784	https://twitter.com/VitalikButerin/status/955486382004342784			
	Now the second question. Now that we know 51% attacks are survivable, can we try to estimate the cost of one? I see two main factors: 1. Cost of loss of service during the attack itself 2. Cost of giving the social layer too much power by over-actively using it	VitalikButerin	99	20	1516640592	955486014264537089	https://twitter.com/VitalikButerin/status/955486014264537089			
	But they'll live on because of much smaller transaction fees. It's cities vs villages all over again; always tradeoffs.	VitalikButerin	5	1	1516640413	955485264255778820	https://twitter.com/VitalikButerin/status/955485264255778820			
	Though an important question is, how easy or hard is this? IMO it's much harder in PoW than PoS, and so PoS can achieve the same level of reliability in practice with a higher frequency of attacks, and hence can survive with a quite low cost of consensus	VitalikButerin	128	25	1516640363	955485054997880832	https://twitter.com/VitalikButerin/status/955485054997880832			
bitcoin 	And yes, in either PoW or PoS, this WILL happen. The idea that if a 51% spawn camp attack happens, all $190b of bitcoin's users will just pack up their bags and leave is absurd; way too much incentive to coordinate and try to continue the ledger.	VitalikButerin	141	31	1516640284	955484722301423617	https://twitter.com/VitalikButerin/status/955484722301423617			
	In PoS, you can recover from 51% attacks by coordinating a minority UASF, and the community can do this an unlimited number of times, but out-of-band coordination is still required.	VitalikButerin	114	29	1516640196	955484353206906883	https://twitter.com/VitalikButerin/status/955484353206906883			
	"For example, if a 51% attack on PoW happens, then the attacker likely has enough hardware to keep doing it forever (""spawn camp attack""), so the community has to change the PoW algorithm to ""delete"" everyone's ASICs."	VitalikButerin	114	26	1516640148	955484153952292865	https://twitter.com/VitalikButerin/status/955484153952292865			
	To be clear: I define a blockchain failure as any situation that causes the blockchain to not fulfill its basic guarantees that is bad enough and unrecoverable in-protocol, and so requires out-of-band coordination among users to move on.	VitalikButerin	115	20	1516640041	955483702481612800	https://twitter.com/VitalikButerin/status/955483702481612800			
	I will make the usual behavioral economics caveat that what people say they want in surveys and what people can be deduced to actually want from their actions are very different, but that just means that the public discourse on this topic is warped and doesn't reflect reality.	VitalikButerin	158	27	1516639948	955483313732538371	https://twitter.com/VitalikButerin/status/955483313732538371			
	Exhibit 1: people are apparently willing to accept basically exactly the same failure rate to avoid 1% issuance as they are to avoid 5% issuance. https:// twitter.com/VitalikButerin /status/955255508700712960 … https:// twitter.com/VitalikButerin /status/955275252174544896 …	VitalikButerin	77	18	1516639869	955482982453796864	https://twitter.com/VitalikButerin/status/955482982453796864			
	My conclusion from yesterday's polls: people have very underdeveloped intuitions about how bad various kinds of 51% attacks on blockchains are and how easy or hard they are to recover from, and tradeoffs between security margin and cost.

	When the amount of security people are willing to give up to cut issuance is the same regardless of whether it's cutting 1% or 5%, then you know there's no serious weighing of tradeoffs going on	VitalikButerin	24	4	1516590833	955277310583853056	https://twitter.com/VitalikButerin/status/955277310583853056			
	Yep! You can reduce block rewards, which cuts issuance but increases chance of 51% attacks.	VitalikButerin	16	4	1516590726	955276859922665473	https://twitter.com/VitalikButerin/status/955276859922665473

	I think there are a number of people who would criticize a bad idea vocally regardless of who proposed it. There's a well known internet effect where it's easier to get criticism of bad idea than constructive improvement ideas for a good idea. https:// xkcd.com/386/	adam3us	20	1	1516642621	955494522355625984	https://twitter.com/adam3us/status/955494522355625984			
	True that looks like a bigger factor than temporary 20% interval speedup due to hashrate increase.	adam3us	0	0	1516640516	955485694507483139	https://twitter.com/adam3us/status/955485694507483139			
	Maybe one of them is. We can make this harder by decentralizing hashrate (buy some miners) and by pushing exchanges and services with 4x overpayment to be more efficient (or move to other services), and by using batching, segwit, change consolidation, priority choice & lightning.	adam3us	0	0	1516640256	955484604168798208	https://twitter.com/adam3us/status/955484604168798208			
bitcoin 	The issue is scarce development and reviewer resources. The incentive model and Bitcoin mainchain security impact does bear analysis of mid-term and long term scenarios. Sidechain opcodes arent as simple as schnorr sigs, which have a clear win with no real downside nor trade-off.	adam3us	39	1	1516639568	955481718336737281	https://twitter.com/adam3us/status/955481718336737281			
	It's like when you buy a transit card, often they charge you for the card, however once bought, you can reuse it multiple times and reload it without charge. At some point the card cost becomes nominal vs payments. Eg you use it for a year and then accidentally lost it	adam3us	6	1	1516639102	955479764013387777	https://twitter.com/adam3us/status/955479764013387777			
	Extra profit could more than offset the cost for a 20% miners. The effect is also amplified by the large services with bad fee estimation paying 4x minimum fee to get in a block.	adam3us	1	0	1516638587	955477606207549444	https://twitter.com/adam3us/status/955477606207549444			
	Empirically you can see small differences in supply move the fee market price a lot. Eg recently temporary fast blocks due to hashrate increase moved fees by a factor of 4 lower. Spam woul have the reverse effect. 10% spam at lowest fee rate...	adam3us	1	0	1516638459	955477066014748673	https://twitter.com/adam3us/status/955477066014748673			
	you can opt to validate only the mainchain transactions and ignore the sidechain commitment (if you dont care about the sidechain, or rely on sidechain transactions, but only for small amounts and so chose to be SPV towards the sidechain and fullnode on mainchain)	adam3us	3	2	1516597628	955305808455262209	https://twitter.com/adam3us/status/955305808455262209			
	it behaves like options on a vesting cliff (BTC bought up front) in practice we have to account for that and tax withholding so we did not end up doing it in literal nlocktime transactions, though that is where the idea started.	adam3us	5	2	1516597533	955305411372044288	https://twitter.com/adam3us/status/955305411372044288			
bitcoin 	not half fees, almost all fees, the incremental cost is just the bandwidth and CPU. the point of BMM was to demonstrate that a miner can get paid in mainchain bitcoin to merge mine via a sidechain block-proposal pool, to show it is not equivalent to a bigger block.	adam3us	3	0	1516597270	955304307951366144	https://twitter.com/adam3us/status/955304307951366144
