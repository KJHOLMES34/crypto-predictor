	Ok, sorry to spoil the party, but I need to reign in the excitement a bit... Buying LTC is extremely risky. I expect us to have a multi-year bear market like the one we just had where LTC dropped 90% in value ($48 to $4). So if you can't handle LTC dropping to $20, don't buy!

	if you fail to pay when more margin is requested (your margin falls near to 44% of market price), CBOE will sell your future contract to cover and avoid the risk that the XBT.F8 price falls below what you have on deposit, and that you then fail to pay at all.	adam3us	10	1	1512958983	940044226150121472	https://twitter.com/adam3us/status/940044226150121472			
bitcoin 	as an introductory offer CBOE isn't charging commission, but normally would. there is margin so you have a small amount of leverage (meaning you can deposit 44% of the price of a bitcoin and buy a future for a whole bitcoin). but if the price falls you will have to add more money	adam3us	9	0	1512958801	940043465139699713	https://twitter.com/adam3us/status/940043465139699713			
	when Alice paid him the BTC, he sold it for $17900, and CBOE deducted $1000 from his account for the shortfall between the $16900 future price and market price. he paid his mortgage with the $16900 and withdrew his margin. (CBOE used the $1000 to pay Alice).	adam3us	15	0	1512958664	940042890129969159	https://twitter.com/adam3us/status/940042890129969159			
	in a months time, the price is $17900, so CBOE credits Alice's account with $1000 extra, so she now has money to buy one BTC on the market and send it to Bob. Bob was worried the price would fall, as he had a mortgage payment in USD, so he deposited $8000 and sold 1 XBT.F8 future	adam3us	13	0	1512958529	940042321743159296	https://twitter.com/adam3us/status/940042321743159296			
bitcoin 	so bitcoin price is $16900 on CBOE reference (gemini). consider alice needs to pay Bob 1BTC in a month for some online work he's doing. she doesnt have BTC and is worried the price may go up, so she deposits $8000 and locks in the 1month price at $16900 (with margin).	adam3us	20	1	1512958332	940041495037362183	https://twitter.com/adam3us/status/940041495037362183			
	XBT.F8 is like a forex future locking in today's price ahead 1month for people with a future need (or speculative interest) to buy or sell.

	Put your eye on the horizon and worry less about the landscape as it whooshes by. Don't try and buy at the bottom and sell at the top: rather, optimize stability across a huge range of possible futures. Focus on personal goals and personal positioning. The future is deeply foggy.	leashless	62	19	1512953833	940022625862111232	https://twitter.com/leashless/status/940022625862111232			
	My advice, right now, is worry less about what it all means or where it is going, but optimize the positions you are in. The sheer unpredictability of the space requires steep risk hedging, and you can be safe or you can be efficient, but you can't do both. Liquid risk is a drug.	leashless	21	4	1512953759	940022317744345089	https://twitter.com/leashless/status/940022317744345089			
	It's important to note that I've spent a lot of time with a lighthouse and an observatory frame of mind recently; I've been more of a commentator and a shaper of the crypto industry, rather than a leader. I didn't know what to recommend to people as *actions*. It's changing.	leashless	11	2	1512953693	940022037539708930	https://twitter.com/leashless/status/940022037539708930			
	So now comes a phase of optimization. Figure out how to precisely express *what business we are in* and do the necessary deals to get it firmly established as the best brand in the world. Make @ Mattereum work inside of semi-fixed terms of reference. Go swiftly down that vector.	leashless	7	1	1512953627	940021763873955841	https://twitter.com/leashless/status/940021763873955841			@
	"yes. 2018: the year of ""blurs"". We may need to hire young people to do our analysis for us, while the seniors get on with running the production processes. We could pool resources on researchers."	leashless	1	0	1512953352	940020610259922944	https://twitter.com/leashless/status/940020610259922944			
	Our @ Mattereum business is entering a new phase too: customers and a ton of new investor activity. We're actually going to build a running business before any kind of token sale, by the looks of things. I feel quite good about that, it feels the right way around.	leashless	19	1	1512953306	940020414008512513	https://twitter.com/leashless/status/940020414008512513			@
	I'm mainly known these days as a strategist, but I'm also very good at optimizing processes - sitting there tweaking a production line and taking out every wasted gesture. I can make simple systems go very, very fast when I'm not looking up at the star charts.	leashless	7	0	1512953227	940020086320091136	https://twitter.com/leashless/status/940020086320091136			
	The fact that I can't keep up with what's happening is more important than my current analysis. It doesn't matter what I think: what matters is that I can barely get there in time to do anything about it. Hence, navigation-plan approaches shift to fire-and-motion type approaches.	leashless	23	4	1512953173	940019857462059009	https://twitter.com/leashless/status/940019857462059009			
	When the rate of change passes the point where you can make maps in time to use them to make navigational decisions, everything becomes driven by execution: go _as fast as you can_ and change direction as soon as it's clear you're going the wrong way. I hate this style of ops.	leashless	20	11	1512953094	940019526372089856	https://twitter.com/leashless/status/940019526372089856			
	I finally figured out what I think about the current phase of operations in the cryptosphere. Events are moving so fast that I can barely compute meanings before the next wave of change wipes out my models. There is a response to this, of course.	leashless	16	4	1512953039	940019296067112960	https://twitter.com/leashless/status/940019296067112960

	There's no question that higher interest rates mean a higher discount rate. But keep in mind that the equity risk premium has been historically large (5-6%, vs. 4%).

	First of all, P/E multiples rise in every market cycle, on rising earnings expectations. Second, trailing P/E multiple for past year has been stable at 21x.

	If inflation picks up, that will complicate things, yes. So far it hasn't, and it's unclear why.

	But in my view, these developments have a lot more to do with trends that were evident pre-election, rather than any policy-induced turning point in the economy.

	Why is the stock market up so much? Mainly because corporate earnings are up. A big part of that is a recovery in the oil & gas sector, due to oil prices stabilizing after their collapse in 2015-16. But steadier, more moderate earnings growth is also a lot broader than that.	prchovanec	22	5	1512949212	940003246042701825	https://twitter.com/prchovanec/status/940003246042701825			
	It does appear to be having some effect on the oil & gas industry, in terms of exports and output. But a lot of other things are too, particularly the rebound and stabilization in oil prices, which was underway well before Trump's election.	prchovanec	1	0	1512948830	940001640609910784	https://twitter.com/prchovanec/status/940001640609910784

	The data I've seen showed that effect on consumer confidence was noticeably partisan, but the positive effect on Republicans was larger than the negative effect on Democrats.	prchovanec	2	1	1512948581	940000599030059009	https://twitter.com/prchovanec/status/940000599030059009

	There has been a noticeable bump in consumer confidence and business confidence following the election.

	For better or for worse, Trump has done little of substance on trade, infrastructure spending, taxes (yet), health care, defense spending, or other issues that might have a discernible impact on the economy's course, up to this point.	prchovanec	143	51	1512947620	939996565388881920	https://twitter.com/prchovanec/status/939996565388881920			
	One of the reasons it's pretty much the same recovery is that very few of Trump's proposed economic policies have been implemented. Deregulation in certain industries is, to some degree, an exception.	prchovanec	107	33	1512947470	939995938277527552	https://twitter.com/prchovanec/status/939995938277527552
