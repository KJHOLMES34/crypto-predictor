	Every technology, every cryptographic algorithm, contains within it a range of possible new societies. I've given you a little tour of this way of thinking, of seeing the world. Now please go and read Shockwave Rider and Alvin Toffler. Cryptosociety needs these tools to work.	leashless	66	13	1523095237	982558755534639105	https://twitter.com/leashless/status/982558755534639105			
	ZKSNARKS do something different: they deliver a viable mechanism for non-transparency high security trade. That's needed by real financial institutions. It's also needed by black budgets and mafias. You're going to need a license for that snark. Or the world breaks in new ways.	leashless	26	4	1523095125	982558288733712385	https://twitter.com/leashless/status/982558288733712385			
	Now, let us add ZKSNARKS and smart contracts. Smart contracts can give us lower cost trade. They can also set up economic machines without owners to profit from them: services without rentiers. (They're miners now.) Is this a new cooperativism, or just more efficient capitalism?	leashless	24	5	1523095006	982557788214906881	https://twitter.com/leashless/status/982557788214906881			
	And this is basically Hayek: get out of the way and let people make their own mistakes. The sum of many small mistakes does not total to the apocalypse of a financial collapse unless you bailed everybody out at every step along the way. Coiners knew this in 2012. All of them.	leashless	31	9	1523094853	982557146540838912	https://twitter.com/leashless/status/982557146540838912			
bitcoin 	Bitcoin is Capitalism with fewer restrictions. Capital issues currencies which are secured by destruction of wealth. When you are no longer rich enough to burn, you no longer get to print money. Perfect oligarchy supports perfect free trade.

	So let's drill down deeper. Let us now ask, given that internet globalism is largely independent of the currency model (Visa) what the real difference is. Who gets to issue the money, and live off issuing the money supply. Answer: it's miners, and anybody with capital can mine	leashless	18	3	1523094600	982556085545553920	https://twitter.com/leashless/status/982556085545553920			
	"""Internet globalism"" is just a *much* more efficient version of what we have today: Amazon-type ease of ordering, but now it's purple potatoes from Andean ecovillages straight to your door, and custom everything if you can afford it.

bitcoin 	The people who get squeezed hardest in the bitcoin maximalist scenarios are the ones who keep their assets in cash and dollars: poor people without property, and the middle classes who's assets are in pension funds and so on.

bitcoin 	In the bitcoin maximalist scenarios, there are two elites left: resource elites and bitcoin elites. San Francisco landlords still charge huge rents but only accept bitcoin. Most of the existing rich stay rich, because most of them store wealth in resources and productive assets.	leashless	16	5	1523094050	982553779735269376	https://twitter.com/leashless/status/982553779735269376			
bitcoin 	There is a version of bitcoin maximalism in which bitcoin parallels gold, and like gold is not used in daily trade. There are internet globalisms on which trade is still done in national fiat currencies or resource currencies. But there is a huge possible overlap. Let us examine	leashless	23	2	1523093835	982552876705861632	https://twitter.com/leashless/status/982552876705861632			
bitcoin 	"So we have basically two competing visions: ""bitcoin maximalism"", in which bitcoin bankrupts the Nation State as merchants refuse to use their worthless unbacked paper, and ""internet globalism"" in which e-commerce expands to encompass all trade. These are not mutually exclusive."	leashless	32	12	1523093683	982552238987137024	https://twitter.com/leashless/status/982552238987137024			
	"So then let us think about ""the better world."" Right now cryptocurrency is a form of elite defection. The early adopters have peeled off into a parallel reality, where start ups have 20 year runways. And very little is coming back into the real world. Yet.

	This does not mean that the contradictions inside of State captialism won't cause financial and social collapses. That's a fact of life today, and historical record, all across the world. Capitalism as actually practiced breaks down and explodes over and over again.	leashless	29	4	1523092518	982547355185672192	https://twitter.com/leashless/status/982547355185672192			
	You have to go all the way into cryptologic secessionism - separating the world of mind from matter - to get that kind of freedom. Maybe States would allow it in virtual reality, but the choke points between the physical and virtual are all too real. Freedom is hard to find.	leashless	35	6	1523091818	982544416874352640	https://twitter.com/leashless/status/982544416874352640			
	Can crypto central banking survive: can cypherpunks continue to print their own money? Almost certainly not. Almost certainly not. Why? Because anonymity technology is weak. ZKSNARKS don't protect you from network surveillance. Encirclement by financial regulators and Facebook.	leashless	29	8	1523091673	982543810034008064	https://twitter.com/leashless/status/982543810034008064			
	Cryptography is why we have e-commerce: you can't move credit card numbers without encryption. Trillions of dollars generated in new trade. But no central bank function, of course. This is just trade optimization. And it gives rise to surveillance capitalism. Not *enough* crypto	leashless	42	8	1523091096	982541390931480576	https://twitter.com/leashless/status/982541390931480576			
	I think it's necessary to examine the link between cryptography and cryptocurrency more closely. Implementing a central bank of the internet is a political project. But it produced a huge, radical revival in general cryptography.

	As I said - repeatedly - i didn’t take issue with Goldberg’s editorial decision. My beef is the hypocrisy of liberals who are shocked, just shocked, at Williamson while employing a gigantic double standard to rationalize away never being shocked by the left.https://twitter.com/schwarz/status/982348607033573376 …	RadioFreeTom	64	5	1523065311	982433239318097920	https://twitter.com/RadioFreeTom/status/982433239318097920

	also not sure I need to do any update this week...everything is hostage to trump here... again we would be neat 2700 and outline would e very easy and clear.. whats next... but tech and fundys don't matter when it come to trump now...

	markets seemed pretty clear of direction coming but you can't predict any president doing what trump is doing... markets are in short term held hostage to him and markets will try to force a solution VERY quickly here now..

	you had job growth but not enough to keep fed on 4 hikes... this would have been VERY positive.. and market momentum was clearly up... IMHO .. we would have had a 400 point up days and SPX near 2700.. of course trump changed all of that...

	Read a lot this AM.. a few points... first was not surprised we went lower early last week.. and then bottomed and started to rip.. I was surprised at Friday.. I put 90% odds Friday would have been a BIG up day if not for trump	Bamabroker	28	0	1523106825	982607362497314816	https://twitter.com/Bamabroker/status/982607362497314816
