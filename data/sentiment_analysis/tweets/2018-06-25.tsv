	To elaborate on the gains: 5% annual interest total in rewards, divided by 21, divided by their share of the vote (1.8%), actually gives 13.22% annualized.	VitalikButerin	21	4	1529935464	1011248747752243201	https://twitter.com/VitalikButerin/status/1011248747752243201			
	That said, being rich enough to single-handedly push yourself into a validator slot *is* itself a kind of attack, and one I *didn't* anticipate. Basically, this means that super-rich participants can give themselves ~10% per year gains, and no one else can.

	Generally, this has been a precursor of price going up. Tether gets printed when people deposit USD and get USDT back. This USDT will then be used to buy crypto. This is similar to someone depositing $250MM to exchanges. Of course, that doesn't mean they will buy right away.

	For the record: I think Lightning is super cool and enjoy geeking out of the research, implementations and network stats.

	I don't have any problem with large hubs, so long as people are willing to admit that it's a form of re-centralization as a compromise for faster/cheaper payments.	ummjackson	2	0	1529956513	1011337033355128833	https://twitter.com/ummjackson/status/1011337033355128833

	The probability hasn't been increasing with the #of nodes/channels, which is not a great sign for that vision of the future. I'm sure it'll improve over time, but just the fact probability enters the picture at all will be a showstopper for many people.	ummjackson	0	0	1529956291	1011336102567768065	https://twitter.com/ummjackson/status/1011336102567768065		#of

	Well there you go! I just saw some charts floating around talking about this and decided to go on a Twitter rant.	ummjackson	1	0	1529956072	1011335183918723074	https://twitter.com/ummjackson/status/1011335183918723074

	They should and likely will... but that doesn't remove the fact that it's still a game of probability.	ummjackson	0	0	1529955971	1011334761048993792	https://twitter.com/ummjackson/status/1011334761048993792			
	Given this current day precedent, I am just not confident that many people would be willing to adopt a system where you walk up to a cashier and your ability to pay then and there *varies* on the probability of being able to hop across payment channels.	ummjackson	17	2	1529955911	1011334509298503680	https://twitter.com/ummjackson/status/1011334509298503680			
	The same goes for (most) every day payments you make through credit cards and services such as PayPal. Barring detected fraud, you can walk into a store with a high degree of certainty that you can pay the store owner.	ummjackson	10	0	1529955709	1011333660648226816	https://twitter.com/ummjackson/status/1011333660648226816			
bitcoin litecoin ethereum 	The problem here is this: With on-chain Bitcoin, Litecoin, Ethereum etc. if you sign and broadcast a transaction to the network (assuming you have internet access), it's going to make it into a block and confirm. It may be slow or cost a bunch in fees, but it'll go through.	ummjackson	7	0	1529955617	1011333274780594177	https://twitter.com/ummjackson/status/1011333274780594177			
	"...and while I know there is progress being made on proposals for ""multi-path"" payments which are then combined to form a single payment, that still does not remove the fact that some payments *may* not be possible."	ummjackson	8	0	1529955494	1011332760554704896	https://twitter.com/ummjackson/status/1011332760554704896			
	In my opinion, large hubs are going to be necessary for # Lightning to achieve material user adoption. Multi-channel hopping is neat, but I'm doubtful most people want to be on either side of a payment relationship where the ability to pay/be paid is probabilistic.	ummjackson	70	10	1529955238	1011331687936978944	https://twitter.com/ummjackson/status/1011331687936978944		#

	Channel capacities grew by 10x while routing probabilities did not change. That suggests that the problem is in the graph structure.	el33th4xor	5	0	1529958619	1011345869428461569	https://twitter.com/el33th4xor/status/1011345869428461569

	"There is the ""value of the token"" versus ""ability of the system to route it."" The former is difficult to build from scratch, which is the problem BTC faced. The tech was ready. For LN, the latter depends on the shape of an emergent graph that doesn't support it."	el33th4xor	8	2	1529958357	1011344767383408647	https://twitter.com/el33th4xor/status/1011344767383408647			
	Study finds that the probability of routing $200 on LN between any two nodes is 1%. AMP might improve this, though it may also quickly deplete the main channels in the backbone of the network. The one thing that will definitely improve this is a hub.https://diar.co/volume-2-issue-25/ …	el33th4xor	162	29	1529957666	1011341870209949697	https://twitter.com/el33th4xor/status/1011341870209949697			
	BCH sees Segwit as backwardation. Centralization, especially in the hands of a single developer group, is a huge problem.

	No, I don't like powerboats. Also, not a bcasher, not salty, and Faketoshi is a fraud and a problem for BCH, though luckily he holds no sway. Leave the tank thief alone -- not cool to make fun of mentally ill people, and he might be one.	el33th4xor	6	0	1529956564	1011337250167246849	https://twitter.com/el33th4xor/status/1011337250167246849			
	The data suggests that it's not a capacity problem. We need more people to establish payment channels. Or perhaps a few big hubs can emerge, simplifying everything except decentralization.	el33th4xor	6	0	1529956059	1011335128965054464	https://twitter.com/el33th4xor/status/1011335128965054464			
	We see that capacity grew 10x while the failure probability remained constant, so it's not obvious that another 10x will help. It'd be interesting to break out route failures from capacity failures. It'd also be interesting to see if AMP depletes network capacity faster.	el33th4xor	11	2	1529955962	1011334722264367105	https://twitter.com/el33th4xor/status/1011334722264367105

	We are seeing some of the emergent properties of LN. In five months, number of routes increased 10x, but probability of successful routing did not increase at all.

	He’s not saying it's not a priority, but is making the nuanced point that the threat of a double-spend is as much of a problem as an actual attack. It's a Damocles Sword problem and it constrains innovation.	mikejcasey	0	0	1529935971	1011250875963248641	https://twitter.com/mikejcasey/status/1011250875963248641			
	Again, not saying that this is necessarily the problem with EOS. I don’t understand enough about the vetting and voting process, or forking options, to say whether it gives users sufficient recourse against malicious gatekeepers.

	My model would deal in perceived threats. Or feared threats. If you’re a decentralized exchange developer and a large number of BPs are centralized exchanges.

	If we could get a clear legal definition of a P2P computer network, formed through contractual obligations we could squeeze out the legal ambiguity about the whole infrastructure. It's a question of definitions from which a much more precisely legally defined network could grow.	leashless	21	1	1529884064	1011033162141589516	https://twitter.com/leashless/status/1011033162141589516			
	The crux of the question is about contractual obligations and performative speech acts. What is it to actually run a piece of software? Is that a speech act?

	Regarding the latter point, you might put higher trust in a digital signature associated with an address containing some money. And even if not, the software infrastructure developing around blockchains can be reused even if there is $0 associated with a given key pair.	balajis	3	0	1529920923	1011187758272921602	https://twitter.com/balajis/status/1011187758272921602			
	The million person genome-wide association study is now upon us. Caveat: many come from sewing together datasets collected by different investigators, with all that entails. Here are a few recent ones: http://science.sciencemag.org/content/360/6395/eaap8757 … https://www.technologyreview.com/s/610151/a-search-for-insomnia-genes-involving-13-million-people-is-the-largest-genetic-study-ever/ … https://www.biorxiv.org/content/biorxiv/early/2018/01/04/242149.full.pdf …https://twitter.com/erlichya/status/1009876318249512966 …	balajis	23	5	1529920151	1011184521876652032	https://twitter.com/balajis/status/1011184521876652032			
	Not really, because blockchain means *literal* financial incentives. That is, your private key now directly represents money. It's hard to set up your life or engineer a system to keep something both (a) secure and (b) highly available when needed. But if money, it's worth it.	balajis	7	0	1529918958	1011179519762239488	https://twitter.com/balajis/status/1011179519762239488			
	Idea is the domain could now sign content that was shown off site. So, http://example.com  could sign (say) an image file such that metadata now includes digital signature and signing domain name. If that image is displayed elsewhere, provenance is now easily verified.	balajis	1	1	1529912041	1011150507040075776	https://twitter.com/balajis/status/1011150507040075776

	Yes. See these related tweets: https://twitter.com/balajis/status/1011044219408928768 … https://twitter.com/balajis/status/1011128224099676160 …https://twitter.com/balajis/status/1011127414280212482 …	balajis	2	0	1529906790	1011128479528640512	https://twitter.com/balajis/status/1011128479528640512			
	IMO, GPG key servers didn't really take off because they didn't provide the right incentives for the added complexity. Tying a public/private key pair to receiving, sending, and holding money completely changes the game, IMO. See also here:https://twitter.com/balajis/status/1011127414280212482 …	balajis	5	2	1529906729	1011128224099676160	https://twitter.com/balajis/status/1011128224099676160			
	Good question. My answer: because blockchains provide an incentive to both (a) keep private keys private and (b) know where they are at all times. This solves a lot of PKI issues in a completely novel way. There's also an enormous technological infrastructure arising around them.	balajis	6	0	1529906536	1011127414280212482	https://twitter.com/balajis/status/1011127414280212482

	Blockchain solves a lot of PKI problems, so many old/good ideas are now possible again. Probably worth a blog post on this :)	balajis	6	0	1529886806	1011044663174680576	https://twitter.com/balajis/status/1011044663174680576			
	That's a good idea. Maybe all of the above. Then http://example.com/keys.txt , the blockchain data associated with http://example.com , and the DNS records (probably TXT) would all have to add up in order to validate signed content.	balajis	4	0	1529886700	1011044219408928768	https://twitter.com/balajis/status/1011044219408928768			
	See original tweet: by periodically hashing the key list *itself* to a blockchain, you may be able to protect against temporary compromises of the site. Someone could compromise the domain, but wouldn't be able to rewrite the chain history. A second layer of defense.	balajis	7	0	1529886570	1011043674203934721	https://twitter.com/balajis/status/1011043674203934721			
	Something like this will become more necessary as stuff like AI-based fake video content proliferates. A mechanism like keys.txt could (a) allow any site to automatically sign content and (b) allow any script to check content against both the signing site and the blockchain.	balajis	58	5	1529886378	1011042866590674944	https://twitter.com/balajis/status/1011042866590674944			
	What if websites published a list of blockchain-associated public keys at http://example.com/keys.txt , like robots.txt? A simple way to digitally sign content created by a particular domain. Could protect against compromise by periodically hashing the keys themselves to a blockchain.	balajis	164	28	1529886136	1011041854069006336	https://twitter.com/balajis/status/1011041854069006336
