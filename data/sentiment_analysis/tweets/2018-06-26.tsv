	"That said, WW2 presents a counter-point to many of these insights. The strategy of seeking ""peace in our time"" in 1930s is widely considered a failure, and the strategy of decisively destroying and maximally shaming Nazis and not letting them save face widely considered a success"	VitalikButerin	2	1	1530045482	1011710197218271232	https://twitter.com/VitalikButerin/status/1011710197218271232			
	My favorite Sun Tzu quote is still the one about never quite surrounding the enemy a full 360 degrees, so that they have room to escape and prefer to flee rather than fight to the death.

ethereum 	Yep, alt_bn128, just like Zcash (pre-Sapling). Here's the code implementing the precompiles: https://github.com/ethereum/pyethereum/blob/develop/ethereum/specials.py#L140 …	VitalikButerin	2	1	1530045144	1011708778624905216	https://twitter.com/VitalikButerin/status/1011708778624905216		#L140	
	I'd add that they're being used already. https://github.com/barryWhiteHat/miximus/tree/master/examples … But yes, no good standard for setups indeed. Seems like the main barrier to widespread SNARK adoption.	VitalikButerin	9	2	1530045044	1011708359647490048	https://twitter.com/VitalikButerin/status/1011708359647490048			
ethereum 	Since when is Zcash a rival? I see the Zcash community as one of the ethereum community's closest allies.	VitalikButerin	23	2	1530044811	1011707383523885057	https://twitter.com/VitalikButerin/status/1011707383523885057			
	Actually, I forgot to mention, there is option (4), roll back the chain to a point known to be before the hack started. If possible, this should be considered; it's a tradeoff.	VitalikButerin	99	19	1530044756	1011707152375746560	https://twitter.com/VitalikButerin/status/1011707152375746560			
	Nope! This is purely a hypothetical.	VitalikButerin	23	2	1530044667	1011706777564471296	https://twitter.com/VitalikButerin/status/1011706777564471296			
	That said, I obviously hope that the ZK-SNARK scheme does not get hacked in the first place :)	VitalikButerin	77	12	1530044649	1011706705321680896	https://twitter.com/VitalikButerin/status/1011706705321680896			
	"(3) does mean that in the case of a serious attack, Zcash may have to abandon the ""holy 21 million limit"" (unless it wants to demurrage everyone to keep the limit at 21 million for aesthetic reasons), but IMO this result is less bad than the other two."

	(1) seems like a more chaotic version of (2) that leads to a bank run, so (2) is better than (1). But (2) penalizes z-address use, and given that privacy is partially a public good this seems like a bad idea. (3) penalizes everyone equally.

	1. If N coins go into the z-address pool, N coins can come out, everyone withdraws at 1:1, except the unlucky last ones. 2. If N coins go into the z-address pool, C fakes created, N come out, everyone withdraws N/(N+C) 3. The C fake coins are accepted.

bitcoin ethereum 	Now, notice I'm not saying that Zcash does not or should not have *any* monetary policy commitments in its social contract. As far as I can tell, Zooko is trying to take a balanced approach, more conservative than ethereum at present, less conservative than bitcoin at present.

	Monetary certainty is the odd one out there. For example, mainstream economists agree that monetary certainty is important, they just focus on stability of price level, not the coin supply.

	"I just don't think ""monetary certainty"" belongs in the same basket. It's not remotely at the same level of fundamentalness.

	I think mature cryptorrencies should in general be very careful about making changes that hurt some constituencies to benefit others.

	It’s frustrating when there is so much gaming. I’ve decided to ignore and reward my followers with a rather narrow focus of self developed content and content of worth. Easier to be authentic but frustrating at times to see cheaters rewarded.	JimMarous	14	0	1529971410	1011399516312961024	https://twitter.com/JimMarous/status/1011399516312961024

	Everybody cheats? I disagree and challenge you to accurately define cheating. Buying followers or having bots to disperse content I believe is cheating. Others call it efficiency.

ripple 	Ideal scenario: Edge would run an instance of Ripple’s Data API to have a quick and efficient data store to support the the wallet and the broader community.	haydentiff	2	1	1529973014	1011406246027636737	https://twitter.com/haydentiff/status/1011406246027636737			
ripple 	No. Validators don’t need full history. If you want to retrieve all transactions associated with a wallet, you need to be able to query a full history server, but it need not be a validator. There are also improved APIs for doing this that don’t require querying rippled at all.	haydentiff	2	0	1529972947	1011405963725824000	https://twitter.com/haydentiff/status/1011405963725824000

In a down market - time is on your side. Moving slow combined with trend can give you better pricing and decision.

	What each of us needs to understand is that to many Germans at the time, Nazism seemed as compelling and logical as the ideologies we ourselves believe in, right now.

	People shrug their shoulders at manners, like it's about what fork you use. But true manners are about how you relate to people, and how you treat them, every moment of your life. They are habits of consideration, in which other people either matter to you, or they don't.	prchovanec	16	6	1530020059	1011603565876514816	https://twitter.com/prchovanec/status/1011603565876514816
