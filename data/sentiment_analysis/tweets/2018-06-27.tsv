	Sure. And people make the same argument for, say, laws like the GDPR. However the level of public complaint about Apple policies still seems to be lower than the level of complaint about GDPR.

	I don't get why Apple's restrictive app store policies don't get criticized more. One company (with market cap approaching $1 trillion) gets more de-facto filtering power over mobile internet users than many governments, heavily wields it, and so few tech people seem to complain.

	That said, I think being paid $16m for creating a thing that's valued at $700m to $3b depending on how you count is fundamentally very reasonable. What's less reasonable is the bubbles that led to all of the cryptocurrencies getting so high in the first place.

	Yes, social scalability in the form of extent of the market and thus the division of labor (ht Adam Smith). Also biological scalability insofar as the resulting bigger ag markets improved ag division of labor thus ag productivity.

	And parallel to the industrial revolution, huge breakthroughs in agriculture. However my thread focuses on some major advances in biological scalability that likely actually preceded the invention of agriculture.

	The same East Asian regions that innovated in biological scalability prior to agriculture also were the first to domesticate dogs. Dogs likely served as intruder alarms for early villages, making them more secure: an increase in social scalability.

	East Asia was probably the biggest early innovator biological scalability: pottery to protect stored food from vermin; alcoholic beverages (made from wild plants) and tea to avoid the need to drink village-polluted water. https://www.penn.museum/sites/biomoleculararchaeology/?page_id=247 …https://dinersjournal.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/07/11/why-europeans-drank-beer-and-asians-drank-tea/ …	NickSzabo4	122	20	1530052273	1011738681667796992	https://twitter.com/NickSzabo4/status/1011738681667796992			
	Farming was the big breakthrough in biological scalability. Less obvious but still very important were advances in hygiene, such as the use of boiled water (as herbal or proper tea) or alcohol to avoid drinking disease-carrying village water.

	The second transition (Party Eras 2 to 3) is more subtle, because the party names didn't change, but their composition and orientation did, between WWI and WW2.	prchovanec	7	1	1530106303	1011965298654765067	https://twitter.com/prchovanec/status/1011965298654765067			
	I could elaborate on each era to flesh this out, but perhaps this isn't the time to do it. But on #4, I have a feeling that Trump is more of a transitional character in the party realignment, not a destination (an enduring coalition).	prchovanec	9	2	1530105955	1011963840949555200	https://twitter.com/prchovanec/status/1011963840949555200		#4	
	Essentially we've had three distinct eras of US party alignment: 1) Commerce (Federalists/Whigs) vs. Agriculture (Democrats) 2) Capitalism (Republicans) vs. the Downtrodden (Democrats) 3) Liberalism (Democrats) vs. Conservatism (Republicans) 4) what comes next is still in flux	prchovanec	21	4	1530105859	1011963438808133633	https://twitter.com/prchovanec/status/1011963438808133633

	What we’re witnessing is a shift in dominant control of both *formal* parties from the Conservatives to the Nationalists, and from the Liberals to the Socialists. The question is how traditional Conservatives and Liberals will respond to this.	prchovanec	16	8	1530105012	1011959886215811073	https://twitter.com/prchovanec/status/1011959886215811073
