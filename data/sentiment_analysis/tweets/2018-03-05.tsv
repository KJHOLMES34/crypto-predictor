	7/ This isn’t to say a crypto-HF can’t do all of the above (there are some that do the above quite well).

	Of course, there is an entirely separate question of how ordinary people react to all this, much as deciding how polluting a river kills some of the animal life while strengthening others. But this is too much for the end of a letter. More of this in my next. /24	RadioFreeTom	123	11	1520231116	970545764316434432	https://twitter.com/RadioFreeTom/status/970545764316434432			
	And pray do not fill your future letters with what horrid things these people are doing. That they were going to run up a butchers bill of sin I knew already. Whether those sins will still cling to them like wet, defiled rags for eternity, I will find out on this end later. /23	RadioFreeTom	129	12	1520231116	970545763448180736	https://twitter.com/RadioFreeTom/status/970545763448180736			
	And remember: you have three years, maybe fewer, and we expect it to be a time of unbroken success, just as mine was in the European Sector a century ago. So keep your mind on your work, please. /22	RadioFreeTom	118	10	1520231116	970545762668072960	https://twitter.com/RadioFreeTom/status/970545762668072960			
	So pay attention to your work, nephew: Bring us food or be food yourself. If you claim that you were hindered by the machinations of K Street or the depredations of Georgetown I am not sure a charge of heresy does not lie against you and I cannot - and will not - protect you. /21	RadioFreeTom	108	11	1520231116	970545761808277504	https://twitter.com/RadioFreeTom/status/970545761808277504			
	"You must prevent all that by keeping them busy. ""Policy,"" like most of the other things which humans are excited about, such as health and sickness, or war and peace, it is, from the point of view of the spiritual life, mainly raw material. Nothing is naturally on our side. /20"	RadioFreeTom	115	8	1520231115	970545760759615488	https://twitter.com/RadioFreeTom/status/970545760759615488			
	In the meantime, get it clear in your own mind that this state of office warfare is not, in itself, necessarily favorable either to us or to the other side.The Enemy, too, sees opportunities here for his depraved notions of forgiveness, repentance, shame, and enlightenment. /19	RadioFreeTom	109	10	1520231115	970545759945928704	https://twitter.com/RadioFreeTom/status/970545759945928704			
	But remember always each soul, from the Old Man on down, is equally valuable to the Enemy. You might think souls such as these fall into hell like snowflakes, but each has to be wrangled away like a wild boar. Once subdued, of course, you may feast on their anger eternally. /18	RadioFreeTom	122	9	1520231115	970545759056728065	https://twitter.com/RadioFreeTom/status/970545759056728065			
	Your job is to ensure that this never happens. A steady stream of rage and paranoia, packaged as “policy” must be proffered for the worst reasons, delivered in the most venal way, and executed so as to cause the greatest spiritual harm. Work with Smegmulcher on this. /17	RadioFreeTom	136	9	1520231115	970545757672624129	https://twitter.com/RadioFreeTom/status/970545757672624129			
	"This would be bad, for it would risk that horrid, asphyxiating thing we call ""Grace"" coming within reach of the patient. (Yes, Wormwood, it would still be available even to this one, despite his titanic sins, and would be a massive defeat for us.) /16"	RadioFreeTom	131	9	1520231114	970545756879847425	https://twitter.com/RadioFreeTom/status/970545756879847425			
	If we allow him to descend to paranoia and a complete disconnect from reality, he loses the moral sense that allows his damnation. If we raise him too far up, we risk that he might see in his wife or children something he once was or wanted to be. This could lead anywhere. /15	RadioFreeTom	118	10	1520231114	970545755969683456	https://twitter.com/RadioFreeTom/status/970545755969683456			
	I do not see that it betrays a confidence or classified information to tell you that the Old Man is a difficult case. His self-awareness is low even by human standards, but still requires delicate handling. /14	RadioFreeTom	130	9	1520231114	970545755093192704	https://twitter.com/RadioFreeTom/status/970545755093192704			
	"You see? The ""good"" or ""bad"" of the policy really matters little; it is but one more means of catching souls, from the top to the bottom of this strange and decadent society. We provide the cheese; it is left for the mice to spring the trap. /13"	RadioFreeTom	146	15	1520231114	970545754166255616	https://twitter.com/RadioFreeTom/status/970545754166255616			
	If, on the other hand, the goal is to rile up the Old Man and get him to take guns in a narcissistic rage driven by a smug journalist appearing on the television we have taught him to love, and thus sow hate and violence, by all means, let him issue a decree. /12	RadioFreeTom	122	9	1520231114	970545753159593985	https://twitter.com/RadioFreeTom/status/970545753159593985			
	If the Old Man gets it into to his head, for example, to limit weapons in order to decrease murders and suicides - and might I say our Suicide Experts in recent years have done fine work - then this should be squelched immediately by tweaking his fear of appearing weak. /11	RadioFreeTom	140	11	1520231113	970545752396222465	https://twitter.com/RadioFreeTom/status/970545752396222465			
	For our purposes, nothing matters at all except how a leader in a given state of mind, in given circumstances, moves large groups of the public either toward the Enemy or toward us, to disgusting comity or realistic, dignified hatred of each other. /10	RadioFreeTom	132	13	1520231113	970545751532212224	https://twitter.com/RadioFreeTom/status/970545751532212224			
	Nothing matters except the anger and the likelihood of sin. This is not difficult. I have been in contact with Smegmulcher, who has the Old Man firmly in hand. Smegmulcher assures me that the Old Man's narcissism is as predictable as a sunset if you approach him properly. /9	RadioFreeTom	147	13	1520231113	970545750642954241	https://twitter.com/RadioFreeTom/status/970545750642954241			
	Leave it to them to discuss whether child molesters or tariffs or due process are “good” or “bad”. Can't you see that among humans without fixed principles, or who have compromised themselves for the sake of power - or even just a reflected glow of power - there's no answer? /8	RadioFreeTom	189	24	1520231113	970545749829308416	https://twitter.com/RadioFreeTom/status/970545749829308416
