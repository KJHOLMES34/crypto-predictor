	two topics a) upgrading to understand the soft-fork opcodes (not validated by un-upgraded nodes) and b) not following/tracking the sidechain/drivechain block. one could choose to not track drivechain eg pool mine it, to be a fullnode on mainnet but pool mine sidechain/drivechain.	adam3us	1	0	1516767085	956016563185954817	https://twitter.com/adam3us/status/956016563185954817

	for side-chains I think an informal hackathon/workshop on design discussion would be efficient. people are focussed on a range of things, and have in mind other problems are blocking for now (eg mining centralisation) however design work can be done in parallel of that improving.	adam3us	8	0	1516765735	956010899910856705	https://twitter.com/adam3us/status/956010899910856705			
	often in protocol design there are trade-offs which are hard to compare apples to apples - multidimensional problem, with multiple factors eg scale, security, privacy, threat-model etc and different people have different weighting assigned to the desired properties.	adam3us	6	0	1516765621	956010422653644806	https://twitter.com/adam3us/status/956010422653644806

	it could be useful to compare the fee rate the transaction used vs the next fee it displaced from going in the block (that got left in the mempool) as it would only have to outbid that. maybe more complex to construct though.	adam3us	4	0	1516764477	956005623837143040	https://twitter.com/adam3us/status/956005623837143040

	you can have a balanced protocol technical view, while asking people to stop wasting blockspace by using it grossly inefficiently (5x bigger) & expensively (50x cost=10x cost/byte) as it pushes out other use cases. while being a HODL/BTFD BTC maximalist. or so i claim :)	adam3us	14	0	1516763129	955999969785384960	https://twitter.com/adam3us/status/955999969785384960			
bitcoin 	maybe, but indirectly it hurts the whole ecosystem, including them as a bitcoin service mid-term https:// twitter.com/stripe/status/ 955878329785053184 … also that has to add up 10x-50x overpayment across many transactions/day.	adam3us	4	0	1516762881	955998930717822977	https://twitter.com/adam3us/status/955998930717822977			
	the other point is @coinbase are not batching, nor using segwit, so if you factor that in (up to 2x smaller from segwit and up to 5x smaller from batching but not fully combining and not always) say 5x smaller (??) maybe they're paying 50x what they could vs @bitstamp per payment	adam3us	30	5	1516762520	955997417656213504	https://twitter.com/adam3us/status/955997417656213504			@coinbase @bitstamp
	so if you could save 90% that means they are overpaying by 10x vs prevailing fee rate for other transactions in the block?	adam3us	18	1	1516762227	955996186510548993	https://twitter.com/adam3us/status/955996186510548993

	So you think you can thwart a botnet operator, whose cost basis is ~$0, by renting from AWS? And this is somehow superior to requiring that he pony up $50m+ to attack? See, this is why it's crucial to argue quantitatively.	el33th4xor	9	0	1516806774	956183032259645441	https://twitter.com/el33th4xor/status/956183032259645441

	And no, ASICs do not intently introduce centralization. Nor do they interfere with experimentation, as the hash function is decoupled from the script.	el33th4xor	5	0	1516801616	956161396131139585	https://twitter.com/el33th4xor/status/956161396131139585

	Common misconception. ASICs provide security. A skewed hashpower distribution is bad, but there's no indication there was one here.

bitcoin 	The default config in node software is to enable listening. However, the problem tends to be that most folks run nodes behind routers and don't configure the routers to forward incoming traffic correctly, thus they end up being non-listening. https:// bitcoin.org/en/full-node#n etwork-configuration …	lopp	19	1	1516829274	956277404422561794	https://twitter.com/lopp/status/956277404422561794		#n	
bitcoin 	If there are 10K listening Bitcoin nodes & 100K non-listening nodes online then there are ~280K sockets available. SPV clients use 4 sockets, meaning ~70K clients can be connected simultaneously. Want to support more SPV clients?
