	BTW what are the properties of your PoT regarding verification time? Asymptotically better than sloth? Would love to see it if so; there are great ways to apply PoT to make PoS work better.	VitalikButerin	7	2	1510285527	928830940012462080	https://twitter.com/VitalikButerin/status/928830940012462080			
	I'm not arguing against the hypothesis that everything will be fine; I'm just not seeing how PoStorage + PoT is *less* susceptible to nothing at stake than simple PoS.	VitalikButerin	6	2	1510285446	928830601179815936	https://twitter.com/VitalikButerin/status/928830601179815936			
	"""Fall behind"" and ""unlikely"" sounds like a probabilistic honest majority model. Nothing at stake is a flaw in the uncoordinated-rational model (or briber-attacker model); if honest maj holds true then it's not a problem at all."	VitalikButerin	3	2	1510285382	928830332769406977	https://twitter.com/VitalikButerin/status/928830332769406977			
	The proofs of time don't help with this though, because making a proof of time costs ~$0. All that PoT does is providing unpredictable fuzzy leader election.	VitalikButerin	8	2	1510285330	928830114686672896	https://twitter.com/VitalikButerin/status/928830114686672896			
	So intuitively this seems to have same nothing-at-stake issues as PoS. If two branches exist, you can farm both with the same dataset, and proof of time has trivial economic cost so can easily run it for N separate solutions. So it's economically optimal to farm every branch.	VitalikButerin	11	5	1510283072	928820644178927616	https://twitter.com/VitalikButerin/status/928820644178927616			
	Sounds like different farmers use different data sets then?	VitalikButerin	2	2	1510282918	928819996276301824	https://twitter.com/VitalikButerin/status/928819996276301824			
	Personally, I think the phase during which anti-aging treatments exist but cost more than $1-10k per year will be short. Perhaps equal in length to the various related patent durations.

	The problem isn't #of dev teams, it's that diff scaling solutions have different pros and cons. Cons of channel-based systems understated in BTC land imo.	VitalikButerin	8	2	1510277859	928798778840059904	https://twitter.com/VitalikButerin/status/928798778840059904		#of

	Saying a Token is Utility vs. Security doesn't always provide clarity on its role & regulatory status. I prefer NATIVE vs. GRAFTED. Acid test for Native is: Without the token, there is nothing, no blockchain, no protocol, no capabilities whatsoever.
