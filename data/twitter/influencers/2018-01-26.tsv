	The arguments in favor of DST seem to be that *without it* workers would be sending kids to school during daylight. Labor force coordination happens regardless, the question is what level of brightness the workers and their kids experience.

	Realistically would still have to be a 2 hour difference minimum, possibly 3 (in fact, I prefer 3, my short term dream is US/CA west coast -9, US/CA east -6, Europe +0, Middle East +3, Asia +6, NZ +9); otherwise would be too early one side and too late the other side.

	Sometimes not just signalling in the economic sense, but also a desire to *promote* being closer to the other region.

	9/ So while the current #crypto market setup is grim, I don't expect us to suffer in 2018 the way people did in 2014.

bitcoin 	6/ If we instead look at #bitcoin 's price action since peak prices, again we see that the drawdown thus far in 2017/2018 has been worse than what we saw in 2013/2014. pic.twitter.com/umlD5tsEkX	cburniske	19	10	2018-01-26 16:15:52	956908553167605761	https://twitter.com/cburniske/status/956908553167605761		#bitcoin

	4/ The #crypto markets continue to feel wobbly at the start of 2018, just as they were wobbly at the start of 2014.

bitcoin 	2/ While negative #PBOC commentary threw off #bitcoin at the end of 2013, it was news of the #MtGox hack in Feb 2014 that broke the market's back. pic.twitter.com/GCxFHhebcx	cburniske	22	6	2018-01-26 16:07:47	956906519848775680	https://twitter.com/cburniske/status/956906519848775680		#PBOC #bitcoin #MtGox

	That would be fantastic and would further discourage bad behavior. That said, we’d have to wade through a bloodbath to get there in the current market environment (which is ok).	cburniske	1	0	2018-01-26 00:06:14	956664539365478400	https://twitter.com/cburniske/status/956664539365478400

	Yes. This is also why the crypto opportunity is still so massive right now. https:// twitter.com/garrytan/statu s/956918381659107328 …	AriannaSimpson	62	17	2018-01-26 17:11:52	956922646972784641	https://twitter.com/AriannaSimpson/status/956922646972784641			
	7/ If you understand the difference between the two, you can use this to your advantage. It's not hard -- just requires a bit of emotional self-regulation, which is critical in most types of investing.	AriannaSimpson	43	6	2018-01-26 17:06:05	956921190605606913	https://twitter.com/AriannaSimpson/status/956921190605606913			
	6/ I think in the long-term, we'll overcome the short term panic selling (as we saw w Mt Gox) and instead the currencies that are proven to be technically weak will die.	AriannaSimpson	18	4	2018-01-26 17:06:04	956921187958972416	https://twitter.com/AriannaSimpson/status/956921187958972416			
	5/ On the other hand, in mid 2017 a flaw in Cryptonote was discovered which allowed malicious actors to print coins out of thin air in any currencies built on Cryptonote -- and prices went up!

	4/ Similarly, the markets seem to be down today on the @coincheckjp hack news, which is rumored to be north of $600M. Again, from what little information seems to be floating around, this has nothing to do w issues in NEM (which seems to be most of what was stolen).

bitcoin 	3/ There is a *massive* difference between the two issues. When Mt Gox was hacked, there was no fundamental problem with bitcoin -- it was a Mt Gox issue.	AriannaSimpson	12	3	2018-01-26 17:06:03	956921181747245056	https://twitter.com/AriannaSimpson/status/956921181747245056			
	2/ It's worth noting that the market seems to be unable to distinguish between hacks (not a technical problem with crypto, IMO will eventually become a much smaller problem) and actual technical vulnerabilities.
