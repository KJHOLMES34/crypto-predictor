	Yeah, but we have been also sold this same bad bill of goods as Europe. You know that right? Over 50,000,000 of the same people have migrated here since the 1965 Immigration Act.

ripple 	AFAIK, you’re correct that the majority of Ripple’s customers are banks. Rippleco sells proprietary software. But I don’t know if any banks own XRP (yet).

bitcoin 	I’m an expert. The stock market has nothing to do with you. You should take credit for the 1000% rise in #bitcoin - an alternative monetary system. Also the 10% drop in the dollar.

	Yes, that's a tricky one. Maidsafe's another.

	25/ If charting is completely new to you, start with ‘triple screen trading system’, a top-down method of analysing the markets.

Needless to say, this comes with immense risk, and since trading is not easy, goes back to why >90% of traders lose money, or rather, underperformed compared to the market index.	onemanatatime	100	7	2017-12-31 15:16:11	947471450146873346	https://twitter.com/onemanatatime/status/947471450146873346			
	19/ From my observation, 90% of traders are underperforming a simple BTC only BUY & HODL strategy. If you underperformed the index being $ BTCUSD , you LOST money! But no doubt, trading alt coins or margin, whichever floats your boat, is a highly enticing endeavour with the	onemanatatime	106	10	2017-12-31 15:15:55	947471381997936642	https://twitter.com/onemanatatime/status/947471381997936642			
bitcoin 	18/ I’m just an average human who found out about Bitcoin couple years earlier than most, stuck to my beliefs, and spent a lot of time observing and learning how to play the game. Even with making a ton of mistakes, I managed to outperform the market, and I’m sure you can too.	onemanatatime	139	8	2017-12-31 15:15:44	947471335126532097	https://twitter.com/onemanatatime/status/947471335126532097			
	17/ Other common mistakes include not (knowing when to) sitting in cash, or BTC, or take positions. Using entire portfolio, being overexposed, taking too much risk, being greedy. Need to learn to be patient, sit on my hands - know when to HODL, when to take profit and move on.	onemanatatime	135	13	2017-12-31 15:15:34	947471296874528769	https://twitter.com/onemanatatime/status/947471296874528769			
	16/ If a trade is easy to take, it is usually wrong. FOMO buy breakouts less, especially if it is only the first or second attempts which usually fail. If a trade is taking longer than expected to move, get out!	onemanatatime	122	12	2017-12-31 15:14:55	947471131820175361	https://twitter.com/onemanatatime/status/947471131820175361			
	15/ It's paramount to form your own opinion on the market, and not depend on tips from others. It’s the only way to remain consistent. To that end, I make sure to clean up my Twitter feed every once in a while. Instead of getting euphoric with Twitter, I use it as an exit signal.	onemanatatime	138	17	2017-12-31 15:14:45	947471090007162880	https://twitter.com/onemanatatime/status/947471090007162880			
	14/ Confirmation bias is another problem, looking for news/tips that agree with my view, adding false confidence. Need to be self-aware, more objective, remove biases. Don’t marry your positions/bags! How will new information affect the market? What will participants think?	onemanatatime	147	18	2017-12-31 15:13:52	947470867537174529	https://twitter.com/onemanatatime/status/947470867537174529			
	13/ Holding on for too long is another painful lesson. Greedy expectations of unrealistic gains. Trading on “hope” will most times end in disaster. Refusing to take losses when market has proven you wrong - can be very painful.	onemanatatime	155	19	2017-12-31 15:13:29	947470769444945923	https://twitter.com/onemanatatime/status/947470769444945923			
	12/ This largely boils down to not having a system in place! The easiest part about trading is coming up with a plan. The hard part is having discipline to actually follow it.	onemanatatime	152	12	2017-12-31 15:13:13	947470705011998720	https://twitter.com/onemanatatime/status/947470705011998720			
	11/ *Never* go all in. If you did on one coin, bought the dip too early, or averaged down in a downtrend, it is likely you end up with no funds left to take on new trade setups. The opportunity cost of doing so is HUGE! Some traders stick to 1/2% risk per trade for good reason!	onemanatatime	153	12	2017-12-31 15:12:57	947470638209425409	https://twitter.com/onemanatatime/status/947470638209425409			
	10/ I’m trying to improve all the time. I may not be the most analytical person, but I play to my strengths, such as listening to my instincts (having trained them for years). I learnt so much from crypto trading this year, and maybe some of these lessons might be useful for you.	onemanatatime	139	8	2017-12-31 15:11:54	947470373213241344	https://twitter.com/onemanatatime/status/947470373213241344			
	9/ I’m a horrible trader and I make mistakes ALL the time. I hold on to losers too long, add to losers, buy full size in one-go, buy too large a size, risk too much, fall prey to my emotions, and sold when I should have held. But we all do this in some way. Losses are inevitable!	onemanatatime	214	21	2017-12-31 15:11:35	947470293294915586	https://twitter.com/onemanatatime/status/947470293294915586			
	8/ Sometimes we make bad trades, get phished/hacked. Whatever happens, get back up, learn from it, move on! Losses are part of trading and the faster you get over that, the quicker you become a winner. If we took all our trades perfectly, we’d all easily be zillionaires by now.	onemanatatime	173	18	2017-12-31 15:11:24	947470244557111297	https://twitter.com/onemanatatime/status/947470244557111297			
bitcoin 	7/ Anyway, my security is horrible. I lost 95% of my coins in 2014 getting hacked coz I didn’t have 2FA on my exchange. Got scammed on bitcointalk a couple times. Got phished once or twice. And I always have to make the same mistake twice or thrice before I really learn.	onemanatatime	170	13	2017-12-31 15:11:10	947470187875352576	https://twitter.com/onemanatatime/status/947470187875352576			
	6a/ @brucefenton made a very well articulated video about this so I won’t delve into it. Highly recommended watch: https:// twitter.com/brucefenton/st atus/938886923392831489 …	onemanatatime	159	13	2017-12-31 15:10:50	947470104819679237	https://twitter.com/onemanatatime/status/947470104819679237			@brucefenton
bitcoin 	6/ Common fallacy is that anyone who heard about or got into bitcoin early is rich today. Anyone who got in before 2015 might have sold much earlier. Anyone who got in after 2015 might have sold 10x ago, or had his coins hacked along the way and have had to restart.	onemanatatime	165	16	2017-12-31 15:10:16	947469961076686850	https://twitter.com/onemanatatime/status/947469961076686850			
	5/ That however took 4 years to materialize. Not only that, but it started with almost 2 years of downtrend, during which BTC lost nearly 90% of its value. Imagine trying to hold on to your beliefs while price declines so dramatically. Not easy.	onemanatatime	197	19	2017-12-31 15:10:01	947469898451623938	https://twitter.com/onemanatatime/status/947469898451623938			
	4/ As a newcomer, its easy to get exuberant about the technology, thinking it will change the world tomorrow and that adoption will happen overnight. Entering BTC at $200 and seeing it rise to $1000 in 2013, I thought it was going to get to $10,000 in no time at all.	onemanatatime	145	23	2017-12-31 15:09:34	947469783586316288	https://twitter.com/onemanatatime/status/947469783586316288			
bitcoin 	3/ By most measures, Bitcoin adoption is still in the early adopter phase and there’s a huge once-in-a-lifetime opportunity sitting right under our noses if we care to look. As I said before, play your cards right and you’ll be able to achieve financial freedom in <5 years.	onemanatatime	215	31	2017-12-31 15:09:17	947469712866254848	https://twitter.com/onemanatatime/status/947469712866254848			
	2/ Thankful I stuck to it, even when nobody around me saw it the same way I did. It was the possibility of financial freedom that first attracted me, but like many others, its not the only reason I stayed. Since August 2013 I’ve practically been following the BTC price every day.	onemanatatime	132	12	2017-12-31 15:09:01	947469644486524928	https://twitter.com/onemanatatime/status/947469644486524928			
bitcoin 	1/ As a follower of tech/startup news, I came across a Bitcoin article in April 2013, but dismissed it as a bubble/fad. Read into it 6 months later, got hooked forever once I understood it was more significant than the internet and was the most revolutionary invention in my life.	onemanatatime	168	16	2017-12-31 15:08:36	947469541105221633	https://twitter.com/onemanatatime/status/947469541105221633

	The best advice I can you for 2018 and all years going forward for both DEMS and REBUPS is check you political belief at the door every day.. it only matters what you think it does.. IN YOUR OWN HEAD.. no place else.. this is the best step you can take to become a better trader	Bamabroker	42	3	2017-12-31 17:50:47	947510357211394049	https://twitter.com/Bamabroker/status/947510357211394049			
	the point of this post is simple.. politics has about 1% of the weight on the US markets than people actually think.. markets are much more dynamic that you know.. the US is the greatest country in the world and one person does not control it...

	SPX is going parabolic.. earrings are great.. and jobs are plentiful.... just STOP DEMS... don't repeat the idiotic mistakes that REPUBS made for 8 years.. or if you keep this up your going to look just as stupid..

	all from REPUB clients I have all over the country..this is what I heard.. . you could not reason with them. just sick and sure Obama would be the end of the markets... 8 years later.. and they all looked like compete idiots...

	"I have clients in almost 45 states... over the last 8 years of Obama..

	the thought that 98% see 2018 stock returns based on the side they vote for.. is absolutely pathetic and a reason why most traders SUCK	Bamabroker	20	4	2017-12-31 17:40:49	947507848560463879	https://twitter.com/Bamabroker/status/947507848560463879			
	what this means.. is very clear... people can't make ANY reasonable view of markets... this means 98% of people on both sides are so sick and effected by the virus known as politics.. they can even think straight.

	51% of people see sub 4% returns and possible negative... of that group... 98% said they were DEMs... 49% of people see 10% returns and a great year... 98% were REPUBS.... THIS IS TRULY INSANE..
