bitcoin 	Many times Bitcoin's rise. It's a long term play. There are technical problems that need to be fixed. And it is being delisted from exchanges. This is why it now only costs a few pennies.

bitcoin ripple 	Technical problems with the code. Easily fixed. After it is fixed it will double or tripple Bitcoins performance.

	You shouldn't rely on opinions of others or authority or credentials in this space. The code is open, deterministic and understandable with some study. You don't need Supreme Court levels of experience, just a curious mind.	jimmysong	23	2	2017-12-15 14:17:48	941658551868469249	https://twitter.com/jimmysong/status/941658551868469249			
	Even non lawyers can read the Constitution and can understand most of the meaning without the help of a lawyer. Read code, get the gist and ask the expert about stuff you don't understand. I don't think that's asking too much for an issue that's technical in nature.	jimmysong	13	1	2017-12-15 14:11:25	941656945252900865	https://twitter.com/jimmysong/status/941656945252900865			
	Why not? You're a smart guy, you learn a ton about all sorts of stuff as a journalist already, why be intimidated by code?

	Hmmm... i think generally, no in all cases, we should be looking for the problems and use cases to fix not the hammer looking for a nail. Id say the same for Blockchain and AI. Don't do it just because.

	for Minimum Loveable Product - The other thing we see a major rise in is the SME space globally. SMEs are so badly catered for in the technology and services and this really drives the core GDP.

	Without doubt they are. Sandboxes are really useful in order to test products in a secure, risk free environment and engage with regulators to ensure that the products they produce are in concurrence with regulations before they are launched. 1/3 pic.twitter.com/6ifN0Bc32C	davidbrear	19	3	2017-12-15 12:49:04	941636220421013505	https://twitter.com/davidbrear/status/941636220421013505

ethereum 	Ethereum has a ton of the pieces of that puzzle: smart contracts give us the reach to really interact with the real world.

	It's going to need *massive* investments in public facing apps that solve real problems - things that really show people they are living in a better future - to justify these valuations.

	Because if a year from now we're going to see the crypto space at $1tn of assets, it's going to have to be like Apple: used by a billion people every day, and loved by most of them.

	But what I'm really saying here is this: at $500bn of assets, the crypto community is a real new global force, with phenomenal technical skills.

	If America's governance recovers from the strain Trump has put on it then the Machinery of State kicks in, trims BTC down to something it can manage (probably with KYC regulations) and you get a safe Present/Future mix, 80%/20% or maybe a bit less. Life goes on: no revolution!	leashless	40	6	2017-12-15 04:24:52	941509333023588352	https://twitter.com/leashless/status/941509333023588352			
	And the but is, right now, nothing is for sale in BTC other than other currencies, and a few share-like instruments in companies that aren't actually doing any real trade yet. We have a huge slab of unhedged political risk tied up in our FutureCoin holdings. This is very unstable	leashless	54	10	2017-12-15 04:24:51	941509331757027328	https://twitter.com/leashless/status/941509331757027328			
bitcoin 	But a lot of people with a lot of money are performing a great hedge against a dollar price collapse brought on by political factors - you can imagine what a Trump impeachment followed by open insurrection in the South would do to bitcoin prices, can't you?

	But The Future shares a geography with The Present. The governments *own* The Present, and you can't just open The Future right in the middle of their turf without a dialogue. If America wasn't turning into a failed state, this massive Dollar Short wouldn't be remotely possible.	leashless	92	22	2017-12-15 04:24:50	941509328544190464	https://twitter.com/leashless/status/941509328544190464			
	Right now BTC is a currency. The *enormous* sell off of dollars to buy BTC is a currency bubble. It's not shares in a company: companies make things. BTC is the national currency of The Future, and people are shorting the Present to buy the FutureCoin. They're shorting status quo	leashless	161	68	2017-12-15 04:20:27	941508225479987202	https://twitter.com/leashless/status/941508225479987202			
	"And I don't mean this daffy consumer spending B2C or darkweb shit. I mean people have to be buying and selling oil and aeroplanes for BTC. You say ""but price volatility"" and I say ""I KNOW!""

	Now, let's talk about Too Big To Fail. Dotcom bubble peaked around 10 trillion of value, 20x the BTC bubble. Consumer spending online wasn't enough to support a bubble of that size. BTC *has* to get industrial uses in supply chain to survive: it has to become a trade instrument.	leashless	94	25	2017-12-15 04:19:00	941507858977427457	https://twitter.com/leashless/status/941507858977427457			
	"I would say ""getting Napstered"" but most people who're BTC/ETH rich are *too young to have used Napster*.

	If we were smart, right about now, somebody would put $100m in a bucket and start buying influence using DC lobbying firms, and whoever does that job at the UN, particularly the ITU.

	AH! You say, but BTC is anon, and zcash can blind transactions in any system with a gateway. Yep, you bet, right on. So there's the battle lines for the next five years: zeroprivacy vs. zcash.

	But the great grandaddy of horrible problems blockchain can solve is terrorist and criminal financing.

	What do we offer at those tables? Well, here's how you get a seat at those tables: you solve a problem everybody wants solved, and that nobody else can solve. Supply chain financing is a really good fit for that problem. So is provenance of goods. So are remittance payments.	leashless	89	18	2017-12-15 04:07:28	941504954602344449	https://twitter.com/leashless/status/941504954602344449			
	And $500bn is a lot of money. It's the kind of money that can buy things like lobbyists and maybe fund some election campaigns. It's enough to be a sector, an industry with a voice and political influence. We start to buy our way into the negotiations of the real powers.	leashless	75	15	2017-12-15 04:05:16	941504404439650305	https://twitter.com/leashless/status/941504404439650305			
	So that's not happening. Instead, we co-opt forces. Big Tech starts selling braindamaged blockchain-lite. Banking flirts with it all. A lot of traders make a lot of money. The lawyers warm. Some of the trade people go hmm. That's a power base. Not much of one but we have friends.	leashless	66	12	2017-12-15 04:05:16	941504403051294720	https://twitter.com/leashless/status/941504403051294720			
	So let's examine the Full Vision around BTC. The economy goes 100% dark. Government can't tax. Welfare collapses, the military collapses, property rights define society, and the nerds inherit the earth. In this scenario we have 299 million new enemies, some with nuclear weapons.	leashless	79	12	2017-12-15 04:02:57	941503818268856322	https://twitter.com/leashless/status/941503818268856322			
	The internet goes through the napster years, then a winter, then the bittorrent years, then a winter, then Netflix and Spotify. That equilibrium holds. DRM in some areas, open formats in others, a sort of messy middle ground detent between future and past forms: a new balance.	leashless	102	18	2017-12-15 04:00:50	941503287496409088	https://twitter.com/leashless/status/941503287496409088			
	We now enter the special kind of hell reserved for innovators that must negotiate with The Great Leviathan. The old order wants many things, some good, some evil. But it holds all the cards that the innovators don't, and that's 95% of the economy and all the power.

	The third thing: now that the regulators are in motion, they aren't going to stop moving. They'll keep going until they've created a world pretty much like the one we have. They are the forces of the status quo: not of *evil* but of stasis. BTC represents nearly violent change.	leashless	78	14	2017-12-15 03:54:38	941501726569521153	https://twitter.com/leashless/status/941501726569521153			
	"The second thing is that the regulators have an *amazing* array of tools at their disposal because people have been fleecing the public for centuries. Law evolves.
