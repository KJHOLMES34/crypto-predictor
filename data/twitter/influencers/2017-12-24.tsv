	I’ll make the first step by committing to not engage in any more debates around the block size, or store of value vs payments, etc but if I see that the negative rhetoric doesn’t scale down then I’ll saddle up again.

bitcoin 	Both are children of the genesis block and Bitcoin Cash has sufficient liquidity and market cap that it cannot be ignored. That said, if you think the other is scam, then just ignore it - what’s the point of fighting, the truth will out in the end.	VinnyLingham	74	9	2017-12-24 20:54:44	945019933930299392	https://twitter.com/VinnyLingham/status/945019933930299392			
bitcoin 	Bottom line, let’s just move on and stop fighting. Focus on whichever philosophy you feel most strongly aligned too. Bitcoin Cash should use the green logo and Bitcoin should keep the orange logo. Hard to confuse them and I think it’s becoming very clear which is which.	VinnyLingham	85	5	2017-12-24 20:54:44	945019932672106497	https://twitter.com/VinnyLingham/status/945019932672106497			
bitcoin 	If you’re long on Bitcoin itself as a technology, you should own both in a ratio of 1 BTC : 1 BCH to avoid risk of either side winning/losing, if you favor BCH, hold maybe 2-3+ BCH for every BTC you own, if you favor BTC religiously, then dump your BCH but remember you bear risk.

bitcoin 	I’m also going to stop calling out hypocrisy in either camp and focus on the positives going into 2018. We have two experiments running - Bitcoin Cash & Bitcoin Core - let’s see who wins in a year’s time.	VinnyLingham	168	14	2017-12-24 20:54:43	945019929438195712	https://twitter.com/VinnyLingham/status/945019929438195712			
bitcoin 	Bitcoin Cash can focus on their vision and Bitcoin can continue along their path. If you feel disenchanted by one camp, switch to the other. If you hate both, move to an alt coin - but let’s just stop the bickering.	VinnyLingham	158	25	2017-12-24 20:54:43	945019928263909376	https://twitter.com/VinnyLingham/status/945019928263909376			
bitcoin 	If you want fast, cheap payments, use Bitcoin Cash. If you want to buy into the Store of Value theory for Bitcoin, then buy and hold it. Mudslinging back and forth between both camps is a waste of time.	VinnyLingham	205	36	2017-12-24 20:54:42	945019926472941569	https://twitter.com/VinnyLingham/status/945019926472941569			
	Here’s a proposal on the block size debate: Let’s stop arguing about it. There is zero consensus for a block size increase for BTC in 2018. Equally, let’s stop asking companies to adopt Segwit or Lightning.	VinnyLingham	267	66	2017-12-24 20:54:41	945019922672795648	https://twitter.com/VinnyLingham/status/945019922672795648

	Good article from zebpay about their experience implementing segwit and optimising fees https:// twitter.com/IamNomad/statu s/944822195695562752 …	adam3us	126	28	2017-12-24 19:05:33	944992456495464448	https://twitter.com/adam3us/status/944992456495464448			
bitcoin 	Switch providers and advise new users to use good network participant competitors. Bitcoin relies on network effect, hurting network effect through short term thinking is a bad idea mid-term even for the companies. Also the tech debt and utxo problems will cost them soon enough.	adam3us	0	0	2017-12-24 19:01:32	944991444649029632	https://twitter.com/adam3us/status/944991444649029632			
bitcoin 	I said someone told me they monitored it and their Bitcoin node uses 1.5TB/mo which is close to some caps. That will increase as more segwit comes online to more like 2.5 - 3TB/mo. Anyway it's non trivial unlike the armchair protocol scaling guys like to think.	adam3us	3	0	2017-12-24 18:55:18	944989876914675713	https://twitter.com/adam3us/status/944989876914675713

	You can also use norelay and blocks only features, to reduce bandwidth consumpition https:// twitter.com/mohamedmansour /status/944987657293008897 …	adam3us	15	1	2017-12-24 18:51:11	944988840602800130	https://twitter.com/adam3us/status/944988840602800130

	So then the design makes no sense. If you want to trust miners, without user validating full nodes, just do it! Eg blockstream has code in elements GitHub for federated servers, and greenaddress has beta support for elements. Choose federation by recent hashrate for example.	adam3us	9	1	2017-12-24 18:45:09	944987321765646339	https://twitter.com/adam3us/status/944987321765646339			
	It's supply and demand. If supply is infinite it becomes a race to the bottom, hashrate falls, fees fall to near zero. People start archiving photos in it as it's nearly free. No one can verify because it's so many gigs so you have to trust miners.	adam3us	18	0	2017-12-24 18:34:26	944984628087095296	https://twitter.com/adam3us/status/944984628087095296			
	People need to think for themselves. Tech evolves, new protocol improvements and unexpected limits since 2009. Huge amounts of progress on scalability eg sync (IBD) was refactored and made 10x faster, four times since 2009. Lightning was not predicted tho payment channels known.	adam3us	61	4	2017-12-24 18:24:27	944982112150671361	https://twitter.com/adam3us/status/944982112150671361			
	I think it's more about focus. They focus on reducing clicks on sign up, on speeding up KYC verification and dealing with scaling their systems from falling over under the load of the stampede of buyers. Saving fees? Using network efficiently? That's an externality.	adam3us	21	0	2017-12-24 17:51:22	944973786432057347	https://twitter.com/adam3us/status/944973786432057347

	The fee estimators mostly do not use fiat (estimator looking at sat/byte history). the only way they are lowered is people feeling it's too much and manually lowering. People really need to do that or fee estimators push fees up.

bitcoin 	Did a batched (5output) segwit transaction for 69c/recipient using bitcoin-qt add recipient feature. Not horribly priced, but could be better if it was a bit cheaper.

bitcoin 	what can change the game is Bitcoin node bandwidth cost dropping to $0/month via #blocksat https:// blockstream.com/satellite/ bitcoin satellite. we do need another step to get super cheap mass transactions. providing $0/mo cost Bitcoin network access to several billion people is step1.	adam3us	90	12	2017-12-24 14:22:49	944921305127768065	https://twitter.com/adam3us/status/944921305127768065		#blocksat	
	a lot of people eg in india have smartphones (my previous startup most of my colleagues worked from our office in bangalore). the base cost can be quite low, and falling fast and purchase can be amortized with HP model where the network provider makes back the cost on minutes.	adam3us	35	2	2017-12-24 14:18:53	944920312931606528	https://twitter.com/adam3us/status/944920312931606528			
bitcoin 	bitcoin sync is better than torrent I think these days. people used to do that before one of the huge optimisation stages. (block sync has been improved 4x by about an order of magnitude each time since 2009 - probably not so much optimisation left).	adam3us	4	0	2017-12-24 14:07:23	944917421072273408	https://twitter.com/adam3us/status/944917421072273408

	Coinbase arb exists to other exchanges also. The spread is mostly on coinbase side. Probably buy imbalance. Also some arb persists even internal to coinbase because some pairs are missing.

	That's a false assertion. Many exchanges are paying 10-20x fees for no good reason, and wasting block space by 5-10x by not using segwit, not using batching, not doing change consolidation, not doing good fee estimation, not giving users priority choices.

bitcoin 	Bitcoin-qt has multisend, manually batch them, I've been doing this lately.

bitcoin 	I’m not sure i understand how you come to this comclusion. It can only be created by miners following the rules and there can never be more than 21m.

bitcoin 	OK. We’ve both said our part. I will continue to use it and you will continue to use Gold.

	So basically it’s not a store of value to you as the returns are too high. I think it is a store of value if you have no intention of selling it - there are many of those.

	I agree that is using as a speculative investment but that is not how many use. Many hold funds in crypto with no intension of selling.

	Everybody is a gambler. If you have a bank account. If you hold money in one currency over the other. If you store value in gold. If you own property.

	That’s just simply not true. What you should say is you don’t know anybody using it as a store of value / medium of exchange. I know many who are not balding wealth in fiat / gold and have no intention to store value outside crypto. What’s true for you is not true for others.

bitcoin 	So at what return rate does something move from a store of value to a scam or ponzi. If gold starts returning does it then become a scam / ponzi?

	Short term incredibly volatile. Long term it’s got a fixed supply, gets more useful each year and the demand has never stopped increasing. Many have no plans on converting to fiat unless they need to spend hence store of value for many. Others speculate just like gold.

bitcoin 	It’s not as safe as gold and that was not my intention of using the analogy. #Bitcoin is riskier but working much better as a store of value.

You still have miner fees to open and close channels, and for larger on-chain txs (e.g. savings account use case).	starkness	2	1	2017-12-24 01:47:25	944731202459701249	https://twitter.com/starkness/status/944731202459701249

	We haven't released for mainnet yet, it was for our mainnet interoperability tests. We have a spike now, but that doesn't mean it'll last forever, and of course I hope it doesn't. https:// blockchain.info/tx/514a33f1d46 179b89e1fea7bbb07b682ab14083a276979f91038369d1a8d689b …	starkness	2	1	2017-12-24 01:29:19	944726648519237632	https://twitter.com/starkness/status/944726648519237632			
	Also we at Lightning Labs created a really cool new light client with privacy-preserving features (client-side filtering) called Neutrino. It's better than BIP 37 SPV on many levels. https:// github.com/lightninglabs/ neutrino …	starkness	4	0	2017-12-24 01:15:40	944723212876869632	https://twitter.com/starkness/status/944723212876869632			
	Lol, as if I don't know about SPV. My point was that this is how blockchains work and why they're inefficient. The need for full nodes is a crucial part of the network.	starkness	2	0	2017-12-24 01:08:45	944721472509104129	https://twitter.com/starkness/status/944721472509104129			
	If someone is paying you, you don't need to have any BTC to open a channel. They can pay the fee on their end. Also because it's instant, scalable, and low fee, funds may be *more* useful on LN.	starkness	2	0	2017-12-24 01:07:01	944721036150534144	https://twitter.com/starkness/status/944721036150534144			
	Not the LN co-founder. LN is a protocol. Co-founder of Lightning Labs that is building the lnd implementation. Luckily people are working on Schnorr, MAST, etc. And hopefully segwit integration!	starkness	41	0	2017-12-24 01:05:19	944720606083371009	https://twitter.com/starkness/status/944720606083371009			
	Nope. Anyone that has more than one channel open can route. Can be on a phone, laptop, etc. I suspect we'll see many more people running LN nodes than full nodes due to the light client aspect.	starkness	6	0	2017-12-24 01:00:30	944719394759954433	https://twitter.com/starkness/status/944719394759954433			
	3. LN is designed to be a scale-free network, much like the internet. Anyone that has more than one channel open can function as a node and route payments. Some nodes will have more connections than others.	starkness	6	0	2017-12-24 00:44:03	944715254432518145	https://twitter.com/starkness/status/944715254432518145			
	2. On-chain fees are amortized over 1000s or more txs. Fees on LN will be very low. Can also relieve pressure from small txs taking them off the blockchain.	starkness	5	0	2017-12-24 00:41:13	944714544190025730	https://twitter.com/starkness/status/944714544190025730			
	1. Whatever on-chain fees are for a pure segwit tx. 2.5 weeks ago @roasbeef opened a mainnet LN channel for 40 cents. It's all a function of the fee market. Hopefully spam will subside and segwit adoption will mitigate.	starkness	23	6	2017-12-24 00:40:41	944714407883497472	https://twitter.com/starkness/status/944714407883497472			@roasbeef

	Well, all I'll say is this. The Indian elites were bred like dogs under the caste system, and they are bred for brains. My family are mostly IQ > 150, advanced degrees, scholars.

	But if you're interested in doing this, no gloves, no rules, no media. I'd probably prefer knives.

	In my case, my military training wasn't nation state military. It was older, darker and weirder. But it was certainly military - there were times when I travelled armed, and I was ready to kill or be killed, under orders from my chain of command.

	You'd be surprised what's working in the older, weirder end of the Hindu tradition. Pacifism, in any form, is a recent innovation for us, and it hasn't worked so well.

	And I am certainly military. I spent the better part of my life on combat and conflict, martial arts leading to the study of geostrategy over time.

	Do not confuse militant or military with fascist.

	Not at all. There is nothing fascist about brown people defending themselves from racist violence. There is nothing fascist about self defense.

	I think the whole Gandhi thing has left people with a very, very misleading idea of how Indians look at the world.

	In fact, I suspect that there are more Indians willing to fight to protect their rights than there are dumb fascist whites who'd try to mess with us.
