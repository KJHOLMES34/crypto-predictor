	2. XRP provides on-demand liquidity for cross-border payments. There is ~$27 TRILLION in capital sitting in nostro accounts that could potentially be freed up.

	Hahahaha. 1. XRP helps convert one currency (or item of value) into another. The XRP Ledger is similar to using GPS.

bitcoin 	I think the biggest difference is that XRP can guarantee settlement in 3.6 seconds. For P2P, that’s not really meaningful. Bitcoincash shows up quickly and that’s enough.

bitcoin 	they could indeed. but they're already charging the users for the fees, so no financial incentive... and probably bottlenecked on users signing up and support costs. maybe a company that is sensitive to fees could do the work for them. or they could do it to help Bitcoin users.	adam3us	1	0	2017-12-10 22:35:23	939971833574518785	https://twitter.com/adam3us/status/939971833574518785			
	problem is there are businesses that dont care about $10 fees, pay that instead of 10c because they dont care. and there are other businesses which are then priced out. and wallets fee estimates are confused by the price insensitive no batching, no segwit, super high pri fee.	adam3us	0	0	2017-12-10 22:25:34	939969361510416384	https://twitter.com/adam3us/status/939969361510416384			
	but any wallet (that is not defective) can receive any valid spend script type, by definition as that is network standard. a sender technically can not even detect whether the recipient is using segwit (if it's using the P2SH wrapped format). spend script is the recipients choice	adam3us	1	0	2017-12-10 22:21:53	939968434632237056	https://twitter.com/adam3us/status/939968434632237056			
	there are two versions of segwit transactions: P2SH wrapped P2WPKH (backwards compatible base58 address format) and P2WPKH (bech32 encoding). the encoding is just a wallet standard, any wallet can send to a P2SH wrapped base58 segwit address. some wallets cant send to bech32	adam3us	1	0	2017-12-10 22:17:22	939967298374217728	https://twitter.com/adam3us/status/939967298374217728

bitcoin 	I think you're misinterpreting the complaint. it's network standard behaviour, on the sending side. in bitcoin the receiver doesnt care what the senders spend script is, just that the bitcoin network accepts it. there are many types of scripts various coins have been through.	adam3us	4	0	2017-12-10 22:09:35	939965339361624064	https://twitter.com/adam3us/status/939965339361624064			
	this is not coinbase upgrading to segwit (which would be nice also), but the claim is correct, this is coinbase selectively not seeing received coins. that means their wallet library code is defective. that kind of thing could be dangerous for them if it fails in other ways also.	adam3us	3	0	2017-12-10 22:07:25	939964795939307520	https://twitter.com/adam3us/status/939964795939307520			
bitcoin 	The Bitcoin network works by consensus logic. If what he's saying is being understood correctly he made a payment and he can't undo it. And their software is bugged.

	it's consensus standard. and the encoding is not seen at the network, that's wallet logic. the difference is P2WPKH vs P2SH-P2WPKH, but that is also consensus standard. if they're losing P2WPKH sourced payments their coin handling code is defective.	adam3us	7	1	2017-12-10 21:53:33	939961303983996928	https://twitter.com/adam3us/status/939961303983996928			
bitcoin 	eventually scaling tech will be adopted due to cost incentive, or when competitors make it a selling point. there are many bitcoin companies that so far *do not care* about fees / scale vs other biz priorities. if you care, and I'd argue you should, switch exchange, processor etc	adam3us	2	0	2017-12-10 20:35:08	939941569649565696	https://twitter.com/adam3us/status/939941569649565696

bitcoin 	you know technically BCH arose as a reaction to UASF, which itself was grass roots movement by Bitcoin users tired of a few mining pools/miners delaying segwit scale increase, that also fixes malleability and enables lightning (more scale). just to keep facts straight.	adam3us	255	36	2017-12-10 03:45:34	939687504306778112	https://twitter.com/adam3us/status/939687504306778112

	There is a disparate power relationship in the reviewing process, and signed reviews mess that up. Anonymity constrains what the reviewer can do. Deanonymizing can turn peer-review into a relationship-building exercise, which undermines it.	el33th4xor	2	0	2017-12-10 16:27:02	939879136264417280	https://twitter.com/el33th4xor/status/939879136264417280			
	I find it annoying when others on the PC do this unilaterally, as it reduces our collective anonymity set. I also think it's not kosher for reviewers to reach out to authors.	el33th4xor	2	0	2017-12-10 16:24:00	939878372213129217	https://twitter.com/el33th4xor/status/939878372213129217
