bitcoin litecoin 	Same reason why Litecoin was not traded on Coinbase until the liquidity existed on GDAX. And this is just the operational aspect. There's also the brand confusion.

	They might trade if on GDAX as it can be quite profitable. To list on Coinbase, they would need very good liquidity on GDAX because that's where they source their coins from.

	No, they involve private communication, and you have no standing other than prurient interest to want to read other people's emails. It's weird that you ask.	el33th4xor	0	0	2017-12-16 07:36:13	941919879564877826	https://twitter.com/el33th4xor/status/941919879564877826			
	Yes, of course I do. And I'm by no means the only person saying this. This isn't some amazing new revelation. A large number of people who don't toe a particular line have been saying the exact same thing about their experience.	el33th4xor	0	0	2017-12-16 07:30:51	941918526654296065	https://twitter.com/el33th4xor/status/941918526654296065			
	I fully share your general concern. What specifically do you think is broken? A list of specifics would be useful; I can point out ongoing work, perhaps, that addresses them. Feel free to DM if you like.	el33th4xor	0	0	2017-12-16 07:24:56	941917036715888640	https://twitter.com/el33th4xor/status/941917036715888640			
	And its counterpart: a discussion or understanding being reached with that company suddenly and unexpectedly puts an end to misbehavior from the no name losers.	el33th4xor	0	0	2017-12-16 07:09:47	941913226643681281	https://twitter.com/el33th4xor/status/941913226643681281			
	A simple progression where someone at that company says that they will malign you unless <some demand>, followed by the no name trolls trying to malign us, on cue.	el33th4xor	0	0	2017-12-16 07:08:20	941912862032842752	https://twitter.com/el33th4xor/status/941912862032842752			
	No, not at all! There are many of us trying to make cryptocurrencies faster, better, more secure and more commonly accepted. And there's a long way to go.	el33th4xor	4	0	2017-12-16 07:02:32	941911402146656256	https://twitter.com/el33th4xor/status/941911402146656256			
	I urge everyone to be liberal with blocks. If someone is being toxic, **to anyone**, just block. Twitter timelines don't have to be a cesspool of stupidity, trolling and brigading. We live in the age of perception control and astroturf. Blocks are the only effective remedy.	el33th4xor	95	14	2017-12-16 07:00:05	941910786359771136	https://twitter.com/el33th4xor/status/941910786359771136			
	The rest are independently badly behaved. They didn't learn their bad manners in a slack channel or troll school. They aren't reading their toxic material off of a laminated card issued by a company. Yes, that company. They chose to make their name by being toxic.	el33th4xor	27	3	2017-12-16 06:57:46	941910200868655104	https://twitter.com/el33th4xor/status/941910200868655104			
	My timeline is readable now that i blocked about 200 ppl. Around 110 are professional trolls, manned by 20 or so people, paid by a company. Yes, that company.	el33th4xor	45	7	2017-12-16 06:55:29	941909627008094208	https://twitter.com/el33th4xor/status/941909627008094208			
	I have blocked people for liking toxic tweets. This is the only strategy I know for pushing back on the coward brigades that are all to common on social media. If someone is an ass, and someone else likes that, they are both part of the problem.	el33th4xor	50	6	2017-12-16 06:54:07	941909281456173056	https://twitter.com/el33th4xor/status/941909281456173056			
	I'm very liberal with Likes, and similarly liberal with Blocks. Life is incredibly short, and there's no need to waste it on people who are not acting in good faith, or not engaging respectfully with others.	el33th4xor	50	9	2017-12-16 06:52:04	941908765015789568	https://twitter.com/el33th4xor/status/941908765015789568			
	Whining about being blocked by me is grounds enough to be blocked by me. No one has a right to other people's time. If your net contribution to my timeline is negativity or stupidity, I'll block. If you don't like that, try to say more interesting or insightful things.	el33th4xor	225	21	2017-12-16 06:42:54	941906458681249792	https://twitter.com/el33th4xor/status/941906458681249792

	Good question. Yes and no. The final version is the best version presented at least. I’m for lower Corp tax rates and lower income tax rates. I’m not for the way they are paying for it.

	9. That attestation service validates the enclave's signature, returning a success/failure message, then signed with an Intel key. However, nothing prevents Intel from being compelled to sign a falsified response! A client would have no way of telling the difference.

	"8. In the case of Intel's SGX, the issue is even worse because even if the hardware isn't compromised, every remote attestation uses ""Intel Attestation Service"", which isn't end-to-end protected."

	7.

	6. One downside is that it creates really strong incentives for someone to find a vulnerability of any kind, including in the hardware.	AriannaSimpson	18	0	2017-12-16 04:45:43	941876968626077696	https://twitter.com/AriannaSimpson/status/941876968626077696			
	5. The fact that it's using Intel's SGX (more in the whitepaper, though it's super short and I'd definitely be curious to dig into more of the details once they release an updated or expanded version) is an interesting approach.

	4. Back to MobileCoin -- once of my concerns is that they have a federated approach, so they're making a clear decentralization tradeoff for the sake of efficiency.
