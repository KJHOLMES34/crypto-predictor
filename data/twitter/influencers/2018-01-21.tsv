bitcoin 	It’s like this for most alt coins. Bitcoin is the leader. Nobody knows for sure if it will remain the leader, or what will dethrone it or when. We all hedge our positions accordingly. I’m a huge supporter of XRP, but I also hold Bitcoin and BitcoinCash.	haydentiff	2	0	2018-01-21 21:49:23	955180545255895040	https://twitter.com/haydentiff/status/955180545255895040			
	I like to be the reminder that XRP can do whatever any other crypto can do. It doesn’t help to pigeonhole it as a “banker’s coin,” IMO.

	I’m not say we shouldn’t have it just I’m saying conferences, blogs, mainstream press etc reflect the state of society. So it’s cause and effect. Change companies and the rest will be it starts not appointing CEOs but in appointing lower level “management”.	davidbrear	4	0	2018-01-21 14:14:00	955065945428578305	https://twitter.com/davidbrear/status/955065945428578305

bitcoin 	If you're going to run a Bitcoin node on a @Raspberry_Pi , I advise against using a microSD card for the data storage. In my experience they tend to degrade after a ~year of read & write operations & your node will crash trying to read corrupt data. Use an external SSD instead.	lopp	730	169	2018-01-21 18:32:26	955130981702389763	https://twitter.com/lopp/status/955130981702389763			@Raspberry_Pi
