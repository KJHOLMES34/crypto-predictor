	This insistence that banks be the ones to use $ XRP is a push for centralization in disguise.

	AUZZIE DOLLAR.. this is stunning divergence here to me.. this looks like a classic top. likely a bearish overthrow and likely a VERY hard turn at .79 is about to happen. now of course most will ask??? who cares About the auzzie dollar right???

	In a perfect world..

	There is no point in 4 year with an RSI this high that XLE did not drop 8% quickly.. .. the other two reading like this saw 30% declines..
