	Let's argue the extreme view. Let's assume the entire world economy was denominated in BTC in 10 years time. No fiat. How would you value the world economy? c. 19m BTC. How do you denominate growth in the value of economy at that point?	VinnyLingham	9	2	2017-12-19 19:34:28	943187795727679488	https://twitter.com/VinnyLingham/status/943187795727679488

bitcoin 	Right - it's wealth transference, from other asset classes. People are selling stocks, bonds, fiat and taking debt to buy Bitcoin because they think it will rise faster due to it becoming a Store of Value eventually.

	"I don't discuss my trades, but that's not the point. This tweet is not about BCH. It's about the fact that everyone is focusing on ""Store of Value"" as a tagline and the reality is that it's not a store of value right now. Maybe it's a wealth transference mechanism?"

bitcoin 	Bitcoin holders don't really see Bitcoin as a Store of Value, but rather a vehicle for wealth creation. It may become a SoV in time, but if you think the recent price rise is proportional, relative to the value destruction in fiat, you're just fooling yourself. #callaspadeaspade	VinnyLingham	255	59	2017-12-19 19:22:45	943184845244473344	https://twitter.com/VinnyLingham/status/943184845244473344		#callaspadeaspade

	Two big reasons: 1) Verifying a Zcash transaction is significantly slower than verifying secp256k1 signatures. 2) Zcash's indefinitely growing spent coins set inherently scales significantly worse than BTC's UTXO set; ugly decisions in the future like confiscation of coins.	peterktodd	31	7	2017-12-19 21:04:49	943210532806459393	https://twitter.com/peterktodd/status/943210532806459393

	As a critic of the bill on many counts, I must say this is not a honest argument, because the main reason is that many of the tax cuts are required to be temporary to comply with budget reconciliation rules /1 https:// twitter.com/thunderpool/st atus/943120965688528896 …	prchovanec	10	1	2017-12-19 18:24:32	943170197359390720	https://twitter.com/prchovanec/status/943170197359390720
