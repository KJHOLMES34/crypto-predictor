	Here's a tip, just in case you still don't get it. If a token lists on Bittrex it will spike like crazy.

bitcoin 	It has to do with how, when bitcoin transactions are first broadcast, they are unconfirmed. It takes six confirmations (inclusion in a block that becomes six blocks deep in the chain) before they are considered confirmed in the blockchain.	laurashin	0	0	2018-02-16 02:39:47	964313326380445696	https://twitter.com/laurashin/status/964313326380445696

	So the coinbase analogy would be They say have lots of pr about large customer numbers. The media conflates customer numbers with price. I comment on that being a conflation.

ripple 	I believe a lot of people are testing ripple products.

	My problem also goes away if I define it as fraud. If a bank made a book entry in my own account - crediting myself 1000 of any asset you choose. That bank committed fraud or is a central bank.	sytaylor	0	0	2018-02-16 18:56:51	964559213111455744	https://twitter.com/sytaylor/status/964559213111455744			
ripple 	Yes. And I'll admit it's ambiguous and varies. The original conversation was - I doubt xrp is used as much as some PR would suggest. The ripple community seems angry about that statement. I also doubt the legal status of xrp as a bearer asset. Recognise that it's a grey area	sytaylor	2	0	2018-02-16 18:52:52	964558209318088704	https://twitter.com/sytaylor/status/964558209318088704

	I for one wasn't aware of anyone using xrp in production and at scale. For the avoidance of doubt scale means more than 20% of the cross border transactions by value or volume.	sytaylor	4	1	2018-02-16 18:50:53	964557711290585092	https://twitter.com/sytaylor/status/964557711290585092

ripple 	I think you just summed up why I find the concept challenging from a financial services standpoint. That appears exactly like what they've done. Which makes it more of an IOU propped up by the believers. It looks to me like ripple* lent themselves a new asset they made up	sytaylor	1	0	2018-02-16 18:48:59	964557234041704449	https://twitter.com/sytaylor/status/964557234041704449			
	Yes the first one. And you can say that one was issued. But not the ones after. Different for xrp	sytaylor	1	0	2018-02-16 18:43:50	964555937154551811	https://twitter.com/sytaylor/status/964555937154551811			
bitcoin 	Agreed. The question is the mechanism and therefore the definition of how it came into being. You can say that no person issued a freshly mined Bitcoin. Harder to say for xrp.	sytaylor	1	0	2018-02-16 18:36:42	964554142642507776	https://twitter.com/sytaylor/status/964554142642507776

bitcoin ripple 	That would work if like bitcoin there were no human that instructed the pre mine of those tokens. Bitcoin has a clear network algorithm we can all see and understand how the Bitcoin comes into being. It's more akin to gold The ripple ledger isn't the same	sytaylor	3	0	2018-02-16 18:33:06	964553235712364550	https://twitter.com/sytaylor/status/964553235712364550			
	Brb need to go offline. I think the agree to disagree is the creation of the ledger and ownership of the majority of the asset that ledger creates is defacto issuance I can see why you disagree	sytaylor	0	0	2018-02-16 16:54:39	964528460977856512	https://twitter.com/sytaylor/status/964528460977856512			
ripple 	Which works IF you believe ripple is a complaint issuer of an asset. Which I think is a challenging position to take Therefore it's not functioning as bearer	sytaylor	0	0	2018-02-16 16:53:02	964528053656440832	https://twitter.com/sytaylor/status/964528053656440832

ripple 	Ripple as a network issues IOUs in return for fiat - much like PayPal would. Xrp is in effect issued by the dominant controller of the ripple network. Ripple labs inc. It's acting like a central bank and that raises real governance questions - that's not a red herring at all	sytaylor	0	0	2018-02-16 16:50:11	964527333498605568	https://twitter.com/sytaylor/status/964527333498605568			
ripple 	I've said before and I say again. For corporates wanting to avoid the banking system ripple is interesting. The concept of a natively digital asset is super interesting. But the creation and ownership structure of xrp isn't as simple as gold.	sytaylor	1	0	2018-02-16 16:47:28	964526650485563393	https://twitter.com/sytaylor/status/964526650485563393			
	It's more like a prospector found gold. Gave it to a VC backed company and that company holds a lot of (and profits from) it's use.	sytaylor	1	0	2018-02-16 16:46:22	964526375880273920	https://twitter.com/sytaylor/status/964526375880273920			
ripple 	That works great if I hold a ton of xrp. Which requires the asset becoming much more legitimate. But it's setup and ripple labs dominance scares off mainstream banks. Large corporations I can see it for. But I don't see a direct parallel with gold if it were gifted by founders	sytaylor	1	0	2018-02-16 16:45:34	964526174817923072	https://twitter.com/sytaylor/status/964526174817923072			
ripple 	No it is an IOU. That's exactly what it is. Unless ripple are a central bank. I exchange fiat for xrp and the only entity that settles xrp is ripple.	sytaylor	1	0	2018-02-16 16:40:17	964524842438414337	https://twitter.com/sytaylor/status/964524842438414337			
	Also paraphrasing what was said, and taking it out of context and using that as grounds to insist on an apology is an interesting strategy to convince someone to do something. I like the concept of a better faster cheaper swift. I'm not sold on xrp. I stand by that.	sytaylor	0	0	2018-02-16 16:39:05	964524540071211009	https://twitter.com/sytaylor/status/964524540071211009			
ripple 	"""nobody"" was not used as an absolute term. For the 100+ companies working with ripple you can cite 6 using xrp in pilot mode.

ripple 	Bearer assets have an issuer. Physical notes are a bearer instruments, the issuer is a central bank. Ripple is in effect playing the role of an asset issuer.

	If we follow the normal path of 10% corrections. We should make a lower low on spx and nymot only hit -200. That is where I want to get long again.	Bamabroker	37	2	2018-02-16 16:07:28	964516585833627648	https://twitter.com/Bamabroker/status/964516585833627648			
	I would expect spx to drop 8-10% from here and yet nymot only hit -200. That is pretty much how every major LOW looks from a 10% drop. And yes I know. Everything things the lows are in. That is the entire point of the nymot move up.	Bamabroker	31	4	2018-02-16 16:04:49	964515918050201600	https://twitter.com/Bamabroker/status/964515918050201600			
	On the feb 9th lows. THE LOW. nymot makes a higher low at -150. This is how most all lows look when down. NOW TODAY. Spx drop 9-10%. Nymot hits -350. Extreme over sold. Nymot the rallies 450 points. That's today. What's next likely. 9% spx drop again. Nymot higher low.	Bamabroker	22	2	2018-02-16 16:03:34	964515604186173440	https://twitter.com/Bamabroker/status/964515604186173440			
	Where we are and what's coming. Imho. Jan 2016. Spx drops 9%. Nymot hits near -300. Very oversold. Over next 2 weeks nymot rallies 450 points to relieve oversold reading and make most everyone think lows are in. Nymot top Jan 25th.

	One post tonight because yes I know this sounds crazy... but I expect to see SPX have a large down move to start soon... possible down 50 Friday that creates the HUGE weekly hammer and then follows through hard on Monday down... and TLT heads to 125 in 10-15 days..
