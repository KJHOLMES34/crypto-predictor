	You could do that, true. I think you’d want to use payment channels though to avoid the user having to manually send a tx each month. It’s all possible, UX and speed would take a hit though.	ummjackson	0	0	2017-12-08 02:06:21	938937760571785216	https://twitter.com/ummjackson/status/938937760571785216

bitcoin ethereum 	Transaction fees on Bitcoin and Ethereum make small pledges (common on Patreon) more expensive than the companies new fee structure.	ummjackson	1	0	2017-12-08 02:04:03	938937180138889216	https://twitter.com/ummjackson/status/938937180138889216			
	Every transfer would require gas, so a $1 pledge would take at least a 20-30c hit in fees? And that’s assuming zero network congestion like we have right now.	ummjackson	1	0	2017-12-08 02:03:03	938936929139036162	https://twitter.com/ummjackson/status/938936929139036162

	(before someone in the space yells “second layer” or “payment channels”, yes, I know. but even then you’d have to open/close channels over time and can you imagine the UX hurdles?)	ummjackson	8	0	2017-12-08 02:00:56	938936398622507008	https://twitter.com/ummjackson/status/938936398622507008

	"If a coin is marketed solely as a ""store of value,"" it's really a latent Ponzi. Where is that value going to come from if it cannot be used? Solely from the money paid by later investors. Ergo, it's a de facto Ponzi."	el33th4xor	305	101	2017-12-08 20:29:21	939215339258224640	https://twitter.com/el33th4xor/status/939215339258224640			
	"This is wrong. If it were true, any Ponzi could be legitimized by simply adding an element of chance into it. Ponzis are schemes where early investors are paid solely by later investors.

	ですねぇ。任天堂は盛んに「友達同士で対戦する」ゲームジャンルをSwitchで推してますけど、「いつでもどこでもだれとでも」の推進とオンライン会員獲得の療法を狙っているんだろうな、と思っています。あの程度の値段であれば良しとする親御さんも多いでしょうしね。	mochi_wsj	1	0	2017-12-08 06:01:11	938996857501499392	https://twitter.com/mochi_wsj/status/938996857501499392			
	Some say Switch would lose momentum next year as there will be no Zelda or Splatoon. But Wii U, which had both, failed. Meanwhile, ports extend sales as more hardware spread. Right now, Switch hardware sales helping software sales is my view.	mochi_wsj	99	14	2017-12-08 05:57:55	938996036525219840	https://twitter.com/mochi_wsj/status/938996036525219840			
	あとは「今年はゼルダとスプラがあったけど来年は無いから」と言うのも不思議。ゼルダとスプラが両方あったWii Uは失敗したわけだし。で、単なる焼き直しの移植ソフトがハードが売れれば売れるほど売上を伸ばしている。Switchは「ハードがソフトの売上を引っ張っている」状況では、とは思っています。	mochi_wsj	95	81	2017-12-08 05:56:18	938995628008337408	https://twitter.com/mochi_wsj/status/938995628008337408			
	ここ数ヶ月色々なサードさんのお話を聞いた感じからすると「サードパーティーがSwitchに積極的になるかどうか疑問が残る」と言われるとまだそんなこと言っているのか、とは思う。	mochi_wsj	41	62	2017-12-08 05:53:08	938994833615609856	https://twitter.com/mochi_wsj/status/938994833615609856
