	indeed. but there are times when this was not the case. eg the $1200 top, and some months afterwards. there dollar cost averaging would have been better. the short and medium term future is uncertain. as a thesis the long term future is moon IMO, but short / medium? crystal ball!	adam3us	2	0	2018-01-20 18:47:31	954772393020424192	https://twitter.com/adam3us/status/954772393020424192			
bitcoin 	lightning is bitcoin: to net transactions, increase transaction capacity, make faster immediately final payments, lower fees and make new micropayment use cases possible. it is a like a write-back transaction cache above the mainchain. replacement payments shadow the writes.	adam3us	5	0	2018-01-20 18:45:43	954771937586069504	https://twitter.com/adam3us/status/954771937586069504			
bitcoin 	during which dollar cost averaging historically was better than buying all of your bitcoin allocation on day1. some kind of moderate mix, overlaid with what you think is probably reasonable. eg buy some nowish if you're starting, but have some money to buy more to lower average.	adam3us	1	0	2018-01-20 18:41:19	954770829803311105	https://twitter.com/adam3us/status/954770829803311105			
bitcoin 	going all-in on day1 may not be best as it depends on market conditions, in a general up market period all in earlier looks better. but bitcoin is both short term and mid term volatile, direction is not that predictable. dont forget bitcoin has had 18month sideways/down periods.	adam3us	0	0	2018-01-20 18:39:36	954770400751247360	https://twitter.com/adam3us/status/954770400751247360			
	another kind of buying is like dollar cost averaging, buy more on dips or oversold news to accumulate and build long-term HODLings probably a lot of people are thinking about that.	adam3us	1	0	2018-01-20 18:38:27	954770110727663621	https://twitter.com/adam3us/status/954770110727663621			
bitcoin 	i'm looking at it as risk lowered in USD terms, as a dollar allocation. historically it has been better to buy bitcoin all-in and hold. so if random buying being average 50% in bitcoin is closer to buy/hold it will win vs dip buying but be more bitcoin than dollar exposed.	adam3us	0	0	2018-01-20 18:20:17	954765538307203072	https://twitter.com/adam3us/status/954765538307203072			
	probably give you a higher return over the last year, as you have all capital working, but that's hindsight, and you have to be prepared for sideways/down/partial recovery for a year+. so for defensiveness I prefer multiple dip allocation.	adam3us	0	0	2018-01-20 18:05:23	954761788628717568	https://twitter.com/adam3us/status/954761788628717568			
	dont forget to account for capital allocation, if you have money not in use, held in reserve to fund a further dip, you are more downside protected, but less in the market for the recovery. so you'll have to pick if that is 3,4,5 or 6x say.	adam3us	0	0	2018-01-20 17:52:00	954758418337689602	https://twitter.com/adam3us/status/954758418337689602			
	yes I would expect buy in 20% dips, and repeat as it falls, and i think you said selling after making 10% to make more than random buy/sell. curious what the optimal dip % is by modelling last 12months.	adam3us	0	0	2018-01-20 17:51:05	954758189353807872	https://twitter.com/adam3us/status/954758189353807872			
	yes, but negative vs just holding. (high variance/volatile exponential function, or more accurately high growth phase of early S-curve).	adam3us	2	0	2018-01-20 17:49:05	954757687220162560	https://twitter.com/adam3us/status/954757687220162560

bitcoin 	"you're not necessarily trying to predict price movements, just benefit from them. bitcoin goes up, bitcoin goes down. say you modelled that as random walk. predicting price movements would be buying the oversold news (""china bans bitcoin"")."	adam3us	1	0	2018-01-20 17:38:20	954754981806055424	https://twitter.com/adam3us/status/954754981806055424			
bitcoin 	I am sure historically it's a losing strategy vs going all in bitcoin. for me it's a dollar allocation (i'm already heavily bitcoin weighted... keeping some cash, and this is a way to make bitcoin related gains and keep the profit in BTC, with a USD allocation).	adam3us	1	0	2018-01-20 17:31:09	954753173163397125	https://twitter.com/adam3us/status/954753173163397125			
	vs if you buy 20% dips, you have to calmly watch 5,10,15% dips reverse and not benefit as they recover. try not to be emotive, don't revise plan on the fly, or you run out of capital reserve for doing 5-6x dip buys. use a limit order and don't look too often!	adam3us	3	0	2018-01-20 17:24:36	954751525301116929	https://twitter.com/adam3us/status/954751525301116929			
	tradeoff is if you buy small dips you run out of funds when it falls further. i settled on using 20% as a threshold, and with amounts chosen to use capital over 5-6x times (compounded 5x=66%, 6x=74%). not sure about time period, look at last year of dips https:// twitter.com/robertreidmd/s tatus/944208162630000641 …	adam3us	23	3	2018-01-20 17:21:32	954750754136342528	https://twitter.com/adam3us/status/954750754136342528
