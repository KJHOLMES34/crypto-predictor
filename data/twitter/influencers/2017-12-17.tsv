bitcoin 	You can do both: buy more #Bitcoin before you spend. Works great. Buy a bit more and keep the change, so each buy increases your position.	adam3us	52	4	2017-12-17 20:36:36	942478653706919936	https://twitter.com/adam3us/status/942478653706919936		#Bitcoin	
bitcoin 	The thread started with someone giving away $86m of Bitcoin to charities and asking for suggestions. Given the source of funds, and the complete lack of funding of the Bitcoin core project @bitcoincoreorg , I suggested someone take the time to ask them to consider it.	adam3us	18	5	2017-12-17 04:59:02	942242708734619649	https://twitter.com/adam3us/status/942242708734619649			@bitcoincoreorg
bitcoin 	I do not believe the foundation is in a position to pay any developers these days. The foundation was always more about events and lobbying. Gavin moved into that area once BTCF started paying him I think also. The Bitcoin core project is about protocol and code development only.	adam3us	6	0	2017-12-17 04:54:33	942241580231954432	https://twitter.com/adam3us/status/942241580231954432			
	He's probably lost 25% of his net worth in the BCH misadventure (said he is now > 50% in BCH) so he'd have to write that off as step one. Doesn't seem like something he'd find easy to do, though it maybe somewhat inevitable and get worse with time if he stays in BCH (IMO).	adam3us	29	5	2017-12-17 04:41:08	942238206321295360	https://twitter.com/adam3us/status/942238206321295360

bitcoin 	A few strong devs who joined recently who have less than 1BTC. Also know several devs who lost big majority of their bitcoins in computer hack, one had 95% in mtgox.

	Meanwhile, we're treated to nightly freakouts about Fusion GPS, from people acting as if they've never heard of oppo. Like this is the first dirty campaign they've ever seen, and thus it negates ALL the other evidence that actually *exists*. /7	RadioFreeTom	470	83	2017-12-17 03:08:18	942214843100291072	https://twitter.com/RadioFreeTom/status/942214843100291072			
	The role of Manafort, the possible quid pro quo in the RNC platform, the fact that Flynn is now a felon - this should have been more than enough. But no. Instead, some texts from a pissed off FBI guy are dispositive that Mueller is on a witch hunt. /6	RadioFreeTom	577	122	2017-12-17 03:06:30	942214388265648128	https://twitter.com/RadioFreeTom/status/942214388265648128			
	"We can argue all day over whether this fits ""colluding,"" and which cut-out from which camp talked to whom. My point stands: if this were Clinton or anyone else, the hearings and fury would be 24/7. And THAT is only the tip of a giant iceberg. /5"	RadioFreeTom	606	141	2017-12-17 03:05:19	942214092688887808	https://twitter.com/RadioFreeTom/status/942214092688887808			
	But I think there's enough circumstantial evidence - including the inability of people like Stone and POTUS himself to stop talking about it - that someone on the campaign helped advise someone what to do with those stolen materials. /4	RadioFreeTom	373	65	2017-12-17 03:04:09	942213797045063680	https://twitter.com/RadioFreeTom/status/942213797045063680
