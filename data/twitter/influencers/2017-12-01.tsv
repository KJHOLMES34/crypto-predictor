	Definitely the former by far.

	So I guess here's where we disagree. I think it's possible to improve the tech to the point where the computational overhead from decentralization is perhaps 100-1000x. Things that accept 100-1000x overhead in exchange for other benefits have succeeded before, see python.

	There are plenty of techs that don't fit well into the above rubric - for example, chairs. A chair makes the person who sits in it more comfortable, that's it.

bitcoin 	Yes, agree with you about money being a social construct. I think Bitcoin’s value has to do with more people understanding the breakthrough it represents. (Or I hope it does!
