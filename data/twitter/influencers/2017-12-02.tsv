	I do believe in public forgiveness and redemption, if the perpetrator shows true signs of wanting to make things right.

	Check this thread: https:// twitter.com/DavidHodge/sta tus/936849343839059968 … - there's a chance Scoble just hosted in own event in their visitor centre and live streamed it.

	When I read this tweet: https:// twitter.com/Scobleizer/sta tus/936725696528842753 … and saw posts on Facebook of him hanging out with people at the Apple campus, I took it to mean it was some sort of special event.
