	I would put social consensus first and weight it far higher. price does not define, and given time to shake out short-term strategic mining at a loss, a higher price mechanically creates more proof of work and more weight chain, so is meaningless in itself, tho it is measurable.	adam3us	5	1	2017-12-21 07:45:11	943734072328769541	https://twitter.com/adam3us/status/943734072328769541

bitcoin 	your definition is also broken. we went all through this before 2x. please adapt to new learnings.

bitcoin 	Steady state it's not clear if high fees are more profitable to miners: in a relatively stable priced, post subsidy era Bitcoin, a fee increase may just increase hashrate, in turn increasing capital costs & electrical costs until the same profit remains among efficient miners.	adam3us	9	1	2017-12-21 06:32:06	943715680700059648	https://twitter.com/adam3us/status/943715680700059648

	It's definitely a shared problem. The only explanation I can come up with is that large providers are too busy scaling their infrastructure to handle higher web traffic.

bitcoin 	Because it's not a crisis for the operation of Bitcoin, it's a crappy user experience that can be resolved in ways that don't require a hard fork.

	"By ""frequently"", prior to every time a package is downloaded would be ideal, though that may require better keyserver infrastructure.

	The way this should work is Debian should update keys frequently from keyservers *not* under Debian's control via HTTPS, to ensure that if Debian's package infrastructure is compromised apt will learn about the revocation and refuse to install the potentially backdoored packages.	peterktodd	23	2	2017-12-21 17:57:53	943888264825655297	https://twitter.com/peterktodd/status/943888264825655297			
	Fun facts: 1) Debian's apt-key doesn't use keyservers at all, which means that if a key is revoked it'll never find out. 2) By default HTTP is used, relying 100% on the PGP keys. 3) gpg and gpgv succeed when verifying revoked signatures anyway.

	As subsidy payers opt out, fewer remain behind to cover the subsidy, incentivizing more to leave. Eventually, only the subsidy recipients will be left, with no one to cover their costs.	prchovanec	2	0	2017-12-21 00:58:44	943631786483044357	https://twitter.com/prchovanec/status/943631786483044357			
	The simplest way I can explain it is this: when you require insurers to ignore pre-existing conditions, you impose a subsidy, from one customer to another. And if you let people opt out of paying that subsidy, they will.	prchovanec	4	1	2017-12-21 00:56:17	943631169207308290	https://twitter.com/prchovanec/status/943631169207308290
