bitcoin 	And we're intent on continuing to improve these mechanisms over time. Though keep in mind that none of this would have existed had we not had 4 years of bitcoin experience to learn from. Imagine what will exist in 2025 with 17 years of btc/eth experience as a basis.

ethereum 	Ethereum's *gas schedule* is definitely evolving toward more resistance over time. There are other features that have nice negative feedback effects (eg. the fact that block time targeting now includes uncles means that a DoS that doubles uncle rates would drop capacity 10-15%)	VitalikButerin	12	5	2017-12-18 08:05:49	942652102999814144	https://twitter.com/VitalikButerin/status/942652102999814144			
ethereum 	None of the attacks ethereum has been so far have been of the type that would behave differently depending on the consensus algo.	VitalikButerin	5	2	2017-12-18 08:03:23	942651488668590080	https://twitter.com/VitalikButerin/status/942651488668590080			
	Dapps that rely entirely on internal tokens can totally fork. Even something like seignorage shares can fork. Dapps that have no long-term assets can also fork.

	Yes. Though we need to separate between (i) subjective safeguards in PoS that exist to counter 51% attacks, and (ii) the 4 month revert limit	VitalikButerin	7	3	2017-12-18 06:25:39	942626895379570688	https://twitter.com/VitalikButerin/status/942626895379570688			
bitcoin 	Imagine if when Satoshi wrote the whitepaper he had five appendices on selfish mining attacks, 51% cartel attacks, attacks on the high-timestamp rejection mechanism, etc etc. Reading that you might think bitcoin is super-complex too.

bitcoin 	If miners 51% attacked to revert three weeks of history, what blockchain do you think would *really* be considered canonical bitcoin a year from then? My money's on the original chain extended with a PoW hard fork.	VitalikButerin	10	6	2017-12-18 06:07:59	942622450524635136	https://twitter.com/VitalikButerin/status/942622450524635136			
	A lot of the more subtle rules in Casper are in order to handle 51% attacks. PoW in practice has all of those rules too, they're just implicit and people just don't like talking about them because that unravels the pretense of being fully algorithmic and objective.	VitalikButerin	14	3	2017-12-18 06:05:23	942621795789586432	https://twitter.com/VitalikButerin/status/942621795789586432			
	Also, isn't PoW dependent on soft mushy social safeguards to prevent a cartel from getting 51% and selfish mining or charging monopoly rent on transaction fees?	VitalikButerin	6	2	2017-12-18 06:03:05	942621213993549824	https://twitter.com/VitalikButerin/status/942621213993549824

	I also think assume huge deficits might be premature as we’ve increased our growth estimates for 2018. Remember the rich still pay much higher taxes. Will make more and pay even higher taxes.

	Specifically, the SensibleCoin with the austere issuance policy winds up with low value in the irrational booms, and the boom chimps buy it all up for peanuts. Then BoomCoin loses all its value when the bubble bursts, but the SensibleCoin fundamentalists are still left v. poor.	leashless	4	0	2017-12-18 00:41:14	942540221006131201	https://twitter.com/leashless/status/942540221006131201			
	How fast you create money, and who gets the money that you create, is Kind Of A Big Deal. A basked of instruments, each with a different monetary policy, trading simultaneously might be great. But it might also destroy the Hayek feedback loops that punish irrational exuberance.	leashless	8	2	2017-12-18 00:39:35	942539803563872257	https://twitter.com/leashless/status/942539803563872257			
	But here's the core question: does a monetary policy that works for a tiny technical elite to bootstrap a currency scale to a billon new users, most of whom are poor by comparison? If not, somebody's going to design an instrument with a suitable montary policy, and scale it.	leashless	17	4	2017-12-18 00:37:12	942539204101332992	https://twitter.com/leashless/status/942539204101332992			
	So now we have a new money supply mechanism: forks, and people either give those tokens value or not. This is either inspired genius, or a bunch of apes in the control room randomly mashing buttons. I genuinely cannot tell which. That I can't tell probably means it's genius.	leashless	13	2	2017-12-18 00:33:43	942538326866825216	https://twitter.com/leashless/status/942538326866825216			
	One of the most crucial jobs of governance is to set monetary policy. Ungoverned systems basically just lash a dead hand to the mast and pray. Maybe that kind of certainty is the ideal monetary policy, but in BTC's case it's fucked because forks essentially increase money supply.	leashless	8	1	2017-12-18 00:31:01	942537649730015232	https://twitter.com/leashless/status/942537649730015232			
	All I'm going to say about monetary policy is this: it is extremely hard, because different kinds of monetary policies serve different groups well, and who you need to be happy in your society depends on a huge number of factorrs. Usually they take turns. Sometimes rich then poor	leashless	4	1	2017-12-18 00:27:06	942536662588018688	https://twitter.com/leashless/status/942536662588018688

	This is the guy who founded VISA http://www. deewhock.com/publications/ VISA is made from banks who hate each-other. Somehow they cooprate.

	It may be that i'm simply too distant from these Foundation type structures to know their problems, but at the end of the day, if I can use these tools without having to worry about how they are governed, that's good enough governance for me.
