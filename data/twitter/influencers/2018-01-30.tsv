	My economic model-in-one-tweet for crypto as a digital asset: * Consider a security company that stores gold in vault, charges 0.2% / year; market cap = NPV of expected future profit * Now, imagine the asset the company secures is *the company's own shares*	VitalikButerin	1850	579	2018-01-30 18:43:14	958395189822967810	https://twitter.com/VitalikButerin/status/958395189822967810

	5000-year history means nothing in an economic model; that would be sunk cost fallacy. Hence, impact of 5000-year history can only be behavioral (either irrational, people following tradition as a heuristic, or schelling point)	VitalikButerin	14	1	2018-01-30 18:34:25	958392972806062080	https://twitter.com/VitalikButerin/status/958392972806062080			
	Why is a tether to reality necessary? Barring behavioral oddities, economic laws are generally continuous; so if a commodity can have great success with a small tether to reality that suggests it can have a nearly-as-great success with no tether to reality at all.

	FWIW I thought you did a very good job on being meticulous with the arguments.

	I would also love to see statistics, if possible, on people who had poor-quality K-12 education and somehow still got into a good college.

	Lots of ICO coins hold their reserves and the price is based on that. USDT is no different. You trust that they didn't mismanage their reserves. If you trade BTC for USDT, you are trusting Tether.

	Why do you think exchanges hold USDT? They hold it for the clients. And if the value drops to 0 overnight, their clients lost money. They should know the risks.	SatoshiLite	58	3	2018-01-30 22:42:56	958455515989725184	https://twitter.com/SatoshiLite/status/958455515989725184

	It was not good for me to sell TBH. I had to give over 1/3 to the US government. Even if I bought back in today, I would have less LTC. I honestly to think that LTC will be worth a lot more than I sold it for and I'm working every day to help make that happen.

	I have sold LTC over the years. So, no i didn't time the market. I did what I felt was right. And yes, history will judge me after many years. I don't expect everyone to understand or agree with me.

	To be honest, that's none of your business where and how much I donated.	SatoshiLite	4	1	2018-01-30 22:23:52	958450717261406208	https://twitter.com/SatoshiLite/status/958450717261406208			
	Go invest in a stock then. Decentralized currencies are a different thing. You obviously don't understand what gives a coin value. No, it's not because the founder has skin in the game.

	You are dumb if you think LTC would be $300 right now if I didn't sold. That would make LTC/BTC over 0.03. LTC fell with the market.	SatoshiLite	37	2	2018-01-30 22:18:44	958449425361207296	https://twitter.com/SatoshiLite/status/958449425361207296

litecoin 	I bought and mined my coins just like every Litecoin supporter. Why do you think I should have a gazillion of them? I did not premine them.	SatoshiLite	13	1	2018-01-30 21:57:33	958444094119751680	https://twitter.com/SatoshiLite/status/958444094119751680

litecoin 	It's better for LTC to have a gradual increase in price based on adoption rather than speculation.

litecoin 	Conflict between my financial gains and the long term success of Litecoin. As I would have financial interest to pump the price and trade LTC to the detriment of the Litecoin project.

	That's nothing in the grand scheme of things. BitConnect had a higher marketcap. And that demand from BCC vanished instantly and didn't affect the market. My point is that the fear of it affecting will affect it more than actual numbers. Your fears are proving my point, right?	SatoshiLite	37	3	2018-01-30 21:22:00	958435144800481280	https://twitter.com/SatoshiLite/status/958435144800481280

	Um, no. I did not know about Bitfinex subpoena. There is such a thing as coincidence in this world.	SatoshiLite	1	1	2018-01-30 21:06:30	958431244169064448	https://twitter.com/SatoshiLite/status/958431244169064448			
	That's not how market caps work. For every coin purchased by USDT, there's a coin sold by someone who wants USDT.	SatoshiLite	15	1	2018-01-30 21:01:48	958430062998519808	https://twitter.com/SatoshiLite/status/958430062998519808

	3/ This becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy. People afraid of price crashing, sell their coins, and cause the price to actually crash. IMO, hodl is the best move to ride this out. And buy the dip. That said, don't ask me to buy LTC as I decided to not trade LTC for other reasons.	SatoshiLite	2655	647	2018-01-30 20:56:41	958428773518422016	https://twitter.com/SatoshiLite/status/958428773518422016			
	2/ If it turns out that USDT is not backed by real USD, the price will crash to 0. This is similar to what happened with BitConnect BCC. It should not affect BTC or any other altcoins. The reason why it does is because people are afraid of it affecting and they sell.	SatoshiLite	2235	680	2018-01-30 20:54:46	958428292293390336	https://twitter.com/SatoshiLite/status/958428292293390336			
	1/ With respect to the Tether situation, it's expected for CFTC to subpoena Bitfinex to investigate if there are any wrongdoings. The fact that the subpoena is in December 2017 and they have still continued issuing USDT is good news. USDT is just like any other altcoin.

	Lightning is a p2p payment. So yes, for the duration of the payment (a second or so), they need to have a node online that the sender talks to to do the payment. Of course, if vendors are using payment processors like Coinbase or Bitpay, they can handle that for the vendor.

	Yeah, but for every buyer, there's a seller. Someone has to have BTC and want USDT for the trade to occur. So that person, who believes in USDT, will get hurt if Tether turns out to be a scam. This is very similar to BitConnect, where people used BTC to buy BCC.	SatoshiLite	9	1	2018-01-30 05:56:56	958202344298041344	https://twitter.com/SatoshiLite/status/958202344298041344

bitcoin 	It may have helped, but why do you think it would cause BTC to crash? Did BitConnect crash affect Bitcoin? Only people who hold USDT is at risk.	SatoshiLite	5	1	2018-01-30 05:49:42	958200525475823616	https://twitter.com/SatoshiLite/status/958200525475823616

	I'm not that concerned. If Tether turns out to be a scam, the USDT token will go to 0 but it shouldn't affect the market much. Similar to how Bitconnect crashed. So if you are worried, don't hold any USDT. I for sure don't hold any.	SatoshiLite	12	1	2018-01-30 05:22:58	958193797573222400	https://twitter.com/SatoshiLite/status/958193797573222400

	No! I started working with Edge (formerly Airbitz) last month. I’ve been a loyal Airbitz user for years. Neither Airbitz nor Edge charges users a fee. The mining fees, which are CUSTOMIZABLE, go to the miners. Dude has a vendetta.

ripple 	The focus was never on the company the way that it is now.

	9/ @simondlr on the core idea and @lkngtn of @AragonProject for significant contributions	FEhrsam	36	3	2018-01-30 18:17:54	958388818251427840	https://twitter.com/FEhrsam/status/958388818251427840			@simondlr @lkngtn @AragonProject
	8c/ The result is an explosion in an open market for micro algorithmic curation hedge funds. And from another angle: a way to directly monetize AI.	FEhrsam	26	6	2018-01-30 18:17:54	958388817429278721	https://twitter.com/FEhrsam/status/958388817429278721			
	8b/ - Curation Markets also provide a way to earn money directly by writing algorithms. Built the best niche news aggregation algorithm? The best algorithm to make predictions from sensor data? You'll earn outsized returns from the staking game.	FEhrsam	19	6	2018-01-30 18:17:54	958388816661721088	https://twitter.com/FEhrsam/status/958388816661721088			
	8a/ Implications: - Curation Markets provide a way to directly bet on algorithms. Since a lot of curators will be algorithms and people will seek returns from staking, they'll delegate their stakes to the best performing algorithms.	FEhrsam	18	2	2018-01-30 18:17:54	958388815885885440	https://twitter.com/FEhrsam/status/958388815885885440			
	7/ More complicated mechanisms can be layered on top, including voting systems to approve/deny new members to join a community (Token Curated Registries), different formulas for monetary policies, and incentives to hold tokens for longer.	FEhrsam	18	2	2018-01-30 18:17:54	958388815118258176	https://twitter.com/FEhrsam/status/958388815118258176			
	6b/ - Feed takeover. What if someone buys a bunch of tokens to advertise irrelevant content? Likely answer: they'd destroy the value of what they just bought, making such an attack less likely. Could also require further staking.	FEhrsam	22	2	2018-01-30 18:17:53	958388812232540160	https://twitter.com/FEhrsam/status/958388812232540160			
	"6a/ Challenges: - Tragedy of the commons. How do you get people to be put work into curation beyond their vested interest in seeing their tokens go up? Likely answer: reward those who curate first/early. See ""Freshness Bonus"": https:// docs.google.com/document/d/1Wt Eae919D0izMUlBgw08aY1Ep6vgybguPKNY7tQWruE/edit …"	FEhrsam	21	4	2018-01-30 18:17:53	958388811427299328	https://twitter.com/FEhrsam/status/958388811427299328			
	5/ Applications: - Decentralized reddit - Social applications with multiple competing news feeds - Setting priorities for a blockchain protocol in decentralized governance - Custom-tailored lists for every individual on any topic. Recommender systems/AI compete for you.	FEhrsam	34	4	2018-01-30 18:17:53	958388810680684544	https://twitter.com/FEhrsam/status/958388810680684544			
	"4c/ For example, if the monetary policy algorithm is ""increase the price by 1 ETH per token outstanding"", 1st token can be bought for 1 ETH, the 10th token for 10 ETH. If I'm the 5th person in I buy for 5 ETH, if community grows to 100 I can sell back to the contract for 100 ETH."	FEhrsam	16	3	2018-01-30 18:17:52	958388809699180544	https://twitter.com/FEhrsam/status/958388809699180544			
	4b/ The central bank has an algorithmic monetary policy. Tokens get more expensive as more are created. Anyone can sell their stake back to the smart contract for ETH at current rates at any time, ETH returned comes from the treasury.	FEhrsam	16	2	2018-01-30 18:17:52	958388808977821697	https://twitter.com/FEhrsam/status/958388808977821697			
	4a/ Mechanics: token holders get to vote on/stake the content of a feed in proportion to the amount of tokens they own. A smart contract acts as the central bank for the feed's tokens. Tokens are purchased for ETH from the contract and are stored in a treasury.	FEhrsam	18	2	2018-01-30 18:17:52	958388808222883840	https://twitter.com/FEhrsam/status/958388808222883840			
	3/ A lot of life comes down to effective information processing. Specifically, creating ranked lists. They are the root of decision making: consider options, rank them, take action. Curation markets can do this on an arbitrary number of topics. Potential scope is huge.	FEhrsam	31	6	2018-01-30 18:17:52	958388807392378880	https://twitter.com/FEhrsam/status/958388807392378880			
	2/ Core idea: the token holders of the feed have an incentive to create the best feed possible to attract as much attention as possible. More attention --> more valuable feed tokens because of their value to others who want their content in the feed.	FEhrsam	23	4	2018-01-30 18:17:51	958388804544471041	https://twitter.com/FEhrsam/status/958388804544471041			
	1/ Token curation markets use economic incentives to create crowd curated information feeds/lists on any topic. Feels like what will become an important crypto primitive: https:// medium.com/@simondlr/intr oducing-curation-markets-trade-popularity-of-memes-information-with-code-70bf6fed9881 …	FEhrsam	255	84	2018-01-30 18:17:51	958388803655184386	https://twitter.com/FEhrsam/status/958388803655184386			@simondlr

bitcoin 	Well it's important to understand that the people commenting on it don't like Bitcoin. Every market is being manipulated and a lot of markets eventually dump to 80% from the top. Top was $20k so theoretically that would be $4k. But that has nothing to do with Tether.

bitcoin 	That's because there are no facts. @bitflnexed sold all his coins around $1300/Bitcoin & got very frustrated.

	Quote is a little out of context, Joe. SEC is not freezing purchase of the assets you list, but instead freezing inflow of any assets into the AriseBank ICO.

	Two years ago, the US personal savings rate was 5.8%, now it's fallen to 2.4%, lowest since 2005.
