ethereum 	If ETH went up by 10x, that would make the system less affordable sure, but then *interest* in ethereum going up by 10x would make fees less affordable by a similar amount anway.

ethereum 	"For example, suppose that we claimed that the Ethereum state was ""the world hard drive"" with a maximum theoretical capacity of 120 terabytes (assume no sharding); you would need to lock up 0.001 ETH to fill up 1 KB of state (now ~$5 for a medium-sized contract)."

	Things we learned in 2017: in the full-blocks equilibrium, transaction fee prices are even more volatile than cryptocurrency prices. This suggests that for costs incurred over time rather than immediately (eg. storage space), setting a fixed fee may actually be not that bad.
