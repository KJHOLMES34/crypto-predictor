bitcoin 	They don’t accept anything other than Bitcoin, but I’m not really sure why since there is other crypto on their platform.	haydentiff	1	1	1512140948	936613138300129281	https://twitter.com/haydentiff/status/936613138300129281				0.24	-0.2425
	Like I said, even if that weren’t the case, it’s up to payment processors to decide which forms of payment they’ll accept. Coinbase and BitPay are the main crypto payment processors. If they hate XRP, it will NEVER be a payment option.	haydentiff	0	0	1512140678	936612007863824384	https://twitter.com/haydentiff/status/936612007863824384				-0.05	0.0177

bitcoin 	The problem has always been the centralization of Bitcoin companies. There are just a couple that decide EVERYTHING. It doesn’t matter how willing people are to spend crypto. Retailers use Coinbase as a payment processor and Coinbase hates XRP so it will never be an option.	haydentiff	4	0	1512140309	936610459255533568	https://twitter.com/haydentiff/status/936610459255533568				0.22	-0.2041
bitcoin 	Because retailers use payment providers and the main 2 that accept Bitcoin (Coinbase and BitPay) aren’t interested in also accepting XRP.	haydentiff	2	0	1512139850	936608533029818369	https://twitter.com/haydentiff/status/936608533029818369				0.05	0.7845
