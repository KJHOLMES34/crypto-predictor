bitcoin 	2013-2014: nobody bothered about USD price of coins. We all just wanted more Bitcoin. 2017: the name of the game is profit, newcomers only look at USD value because Satoshi are confusing. Truth is tho, if any trade you take makes less $ than holding BTC, it's not a good trade. https:// twitter.com/bbands/status/ 928703470839799808 …	onemanatatime	88	15	1513466883	942174514753912833	https://twitter.com/onemanatatime/status/942174514753912833				0.24	0.0362

bitcoin 	"""Bitcoin has the same level or risk as gambling""... This is ironic coming from the same people selling you casinos and lottery tickets. Buying high is risky but nothing compared to the shitty odds and absolute loss that comes with pure gambling. http:// cnb.cx/2CqrirQ"	CryptoHustle	222	68	1513530165	942439937613422594	https://twitter.com/CryptoHustle/status/942439937613422594				-0.05	-0.3128

bitcoin 	Well the Bitcoin price can always go down, but your followers can never go down, unless you start posting very strange things. So for now we're good. Lets see how it is after a Bitcoin correction. Maybe now your followers are support instead of resistance for the price.

	6/ In short, don’t let someone *tell* you they’re going to be next gen #crypto . Let them *prove* it w/ action & adoption, and manage your position over time based on their thesis & claims playing out (or not).	cburniske	118	20	1513526610	942425028288831488	https://twitter.com/cburniske/status/942425028288831488		#crypto		0.23	0.1012
bitcoin ethereum 	5/ I worry for people that are looking for the “next #Bitcoin ” or “next #Ethereum ,” and thus buy into rosy pictures painted by teams that will overpromise and underdeliver.	cburniske	87	24	1513526413	942424201746632704	https://twitter.com/cburniske/status/942424201746632704		#Bitcoin #Ethereum		0.19	-0.4404
	4/ I have no doubt there will be a great amount of innovation w/ new #cryptos , but am immediately skeptical when a project labels itself as “next gen.” It’s like proclaiming oneself to be a genius. Others do that for you.	cburniske	61	8	1513526333	942423865082433537	https://twitter.com/cburniske/status/942423865082433537		#cryptos		0.29	0.1591
bitcoin ethereum 	3/ First thing to check for are the priors of the dev team for said “next gen” #cryptoasset . What qualifies them to do better than the massive brains behind #Bitcoin , #Ethereum , and other predecessors?	cburniske	76	12	1513526198	942423300055105536	https://twitter.com/cburniske/status/942423300055105536		#cryptoasset #Bitcoin #Ethereum		0.14	0.2202
	1/ Be careful of self-labeled “next gen” #cryptoasets that promise to solve all the problems of their predecessors.	cburniske	223	67	1513526088	942422836404252672	https://twitter.com/cburniske/status/942422836404252672		#cryptoasets		0.06	0.25
	4/ While the first half of 2017 represented a monster leg for $ ETH , the second half has been relatively tame (by 2017 #crypto standards). All eyes on Q1 2018 and Casper.	cburniske	61	9	1513521647	942404210422927363	https://twitter.com/cburniske/status/942404210422927363		#crypto		0.27	0.0
bitcoin ethereum 	3/ Will be curious to watch what happens between $ ETH and its siblings if sentiment turns, or #Ethereum gets through its own wall of worry (as #Bitcoin has done in 2017).	cburniske	37	6	1513521515	942403657680740352	https://twitter.com/cburniske/status/942403657680740352		#Ethereum #Bitcoin		0.22	-0.1531
	2/ there’s also the little explored idea of “market beta” in #crypto . The aforementioned “small caps” anecdotally have higher betas, and so should outperform in a broadly bullish environment	cburniske	42	6	1513521447	942403370370961408	https://twitter.com/cburniske/status/942403370370961408		#crypto		0.07	0.0
ethereum 	1/ $ ETH competitors (e.g., $ EOS , $ NEO & $ ETC ) have mostly outperformed their elder sibling in this leg of the #crypto bull market, likely due to concerns around #Ethereum scaling.	cburniske	164	47	1513521338	942402912952770560	https://twitter.com/cburniske/status/942402912952770560		#crypto #Ethereum		0.34	0.0
	I back of the enveloped the “speculation multiple” between 2-10x a few months ago, put out a long thread on it then. The math is basically: how many new users per day X average $ buy in per user X number of days. That gives fiat inflow. Anything above is crypto2crypto driven	cburniske	21	8	1513475180	942209312801349633	https://twitter.com/cburniske/status/942209312801349633				0.10	0.0193
	I try and look at it as a whole for the crypto space, since so many of these assets can only be purchased via $ BTC or $ ETH as the pair (hence it must be crypto2crypto for many assets)	cburniske	9	5	1513475041	942208730619314176	https://twitter.com/cburniske/status/942208730619314176				0.23	0.1779
	Yes, the question for me has always been how much price appreciation is due to “new fiat” vs “crypto2crypto,” the latter of which can become a house of cards. The amplification of value due to crypto2crypto we could call a “speculation multiple?”	cburniske	43	9	1513474976	942208460007071744	https://twitter.com/cburniske/status/942208460007071744				0.29	0.5292

bitcoin 	There are plenty of good reasons to be skeptical of bitcoin. Literally zero of them involve tulips. Please please please come up with better bear arguments so we can at least have a constructive conversation!
