bitcoin 	If bitcoin was *exempted from cap gains and investment income tax* (which is what I am advocating for) it would be easier to use as a medium of exchange, bc you wouldn’t have to calculate your valuations on every single transaction.

bitcoin 	Bitcoin (and “convertible virtual currencies”) and gold are taxed as commodities in the US, thus making it very difficult for consumers to practically use as a medium of exchange.
