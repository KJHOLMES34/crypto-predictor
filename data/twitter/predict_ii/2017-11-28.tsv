bitcoin ripple 	When banks get around to updating their infrastructure (most are in NO hurry) then yes, they will most likely use @Ripple . But that’s not what I’m talking about right now. I’m talking about the QE money that has been retained by FI’s... #Bitcoin #xrpthestandard https:// twitter.com/elyrad/status/ 935540687725936641 …	haydentiff	18	6	1511886130	935544354508328960	https://twitter.com/haydentiff/status/935544354508328960		#Bitcoin #xrpthestandard	@Ripple	0.14	-0.0114
bitcoin 	IME, the narrative (which is constantly pushed) about banks being afraid of #Bitcoin is false. Bankers like it, own it, & view it as a novelty -not as a threat.
