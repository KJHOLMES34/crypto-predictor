bitcoin 	Back to the original tweet for this thread. The crypto community lives on the belief that there won’t be a “run on the bank” and that market participants will only convert to fiat as & when they need fiat. This is ironically in stark contrast to why Bitcoin was born in 2008!	VinnyLingham	102	14	1519440953	967231579855532038	https://twitter.com/VinnyLingham/status/967231579855532038				0.00	0.1061
	Unless BTC & ETH can hit new highs soon, I believe we will see somewhat of a 2014 era bear market cycle. BTC & ETH are effectively acting as the reserve currency for the crypto industry.	VinnyLingham	141	38	1519440953	967231577594806273	https://twitter.com/VinnyLingham/status/967231577594806273				0.14	0.2202
	The problem really comes in when the net monthly sales of crypto to fund mining and operations for over 3500 projects/companies exceeds the net fiat entering the market. The current bear market cycle means that you need to sell more crypto to get the same amount of cash out.	VinnyLingham	36	5	1519440951	967231572779741184	https://twitter.com/VinnyLingham/status/967231572779741184				0.10	-0.2009
	So every month they need to sell a little bit of crypto to pay the bills. That works well in a bull market. In a bear market, not so much. Essentially the ecosystem of innovation is funded by the fiat that has entered the system or is available when bills need to be paid.

bitcoin 	Bitcoin was designed as a system to take on the big banks and fractional reserve system. What I’m seeing now is that a large number of funded crypto projects are only holding crypto and their runways are fluctuating every day.

bitcoin 	The multitude of fork attempts over the years has shown that the miners don't control Bitcoin. The only scenario in which I see a PoW change is if miners start reorganizing blocks to double spend, or to censor transactions. That would be cause for an emergency response.	lopp	19	6	1519492740	967448791199576065	https://twitter.com/lopp/status/967448791199576065				0.19	-0.3271
