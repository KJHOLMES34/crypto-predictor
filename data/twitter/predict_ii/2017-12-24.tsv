bitcoin 	I have to ask one last question: I just put out a tweet storm meant to be in good spirits and asking everyone just to be respectful.

bitcoin 	Both are children of the genesis block and Bitcoin Cash has sufficient liquidity and market cap that it cannot be ignored. That said, if you think the other is scam, then just ignore it - what’s the point of fighting, the truth will out in the end.

bitcoin 	Bottom line, let’s just move on and stop fighting. Focus on whichever philosophy you feel most strongly aligned too. Bitcoin Cash should use the green logo and Bitcoin should keep the orange logo. Hard to confuse them and I think it’s becoming very clear which is which.

bitcoin 	If you’re long on Bitcoin itself as a technology, you should own both in a ratio of 1 BTC : 1 BCH to avoid risk of either side winning/losing, if you favor BCH, hold maybe 2-3+ BCH for every BTC you own, if you favor BTC religiously, then dump your BCH but remember you bear risk.

bitcoin 	Bitcoin Cash can focus on their vision and Bitcoin can continue along their path. If you feel disenchanted by one camp, switch to the other.

bitcoin 	OK. We’ve both said our part. I will continue to use it and you will continue to use Gold. I believe #Bitcoin is many difffrent things to many different people, you believes it’s a Ponzi scheme and scam. My guess it your child will store value differently to you in the future.

	I agree that is using as a speculative investment but that is not how many use. Many hold funds in crypto with no intension of selling. They simply hold and spend crypto and covert if the merchant forces them to. That is a store of value for them.

	That’s just simply not true. What you should say is you don’t know anybody using it as a store of value / medium of exchange. I know many who are not balding wealth in fiat / gold and have no intention to store value outside crypto. What’s true for you is not true for others.

bitcoin 	So at what return rate does something move from a store of value to a scam or ponzi. If gold starts returning does it then become a scam / ponzi? The scam / ponzi arguments stopped years ago when the newbies learn how #Bitcoin worked. Have you studied the economics yet?

	That maybe true today. Each year the number of users is increasing at a very fast rate. It’s not there yer because still many skeptics that will be on one side or the other but my prediction is that it will be. I don’t see any reversal in the trend from here. Do you hold crypto?

bitcoin 	I don’t think anybody that uses #Bitcoin as a store of value feels stupid even if gold holders are saying that because they are bored of no returns.	SimonDixonTwitt	2	0	1514112887	944884050753392640	https://twitter.com/SimonDixonTwitt/status/944884050753392640		#Bitcoin		-0.04	-0.6486
bitcoin 	It’s not as safe as gold and that was not my intention of using the analogy. #Bitcoin is riskier but working much better as a store of value. That’s why gold is a hedge against Bitcoin failure for many with a lot lower return for the lower risk. #Bitcoin has more utility for many	SimonDixonTwitt	1	0	1514112749	944883470656032768	https://twitter.com/SimonDixonTwitt/status/944883470656032768		#Bitcoin #Bitcoin		0.07	-0.1084
