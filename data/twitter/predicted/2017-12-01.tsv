	Like I said, even if that weren’t the case, it’s up to payment processors to decide which forms of payment they’ll accept. Coinbase and BitPay are the main crypto payment processors. If they hate XRP, it will NEVER be a payment option.	haydentiff	0	0	1512140678	936612007863824384	https://twitter.com/haydentiff/status/936612007863824384				-0.05	0.0177	0

bitcoin 	The problem has always been the centralization of Bitcoin companies. There are just a couple that decide EVERYTHING. It doesn’t matter how willing people are to spend crypto. Retailers use Coinbase as a payment processor and Coinbase hates XRP so it will never be an option.	haydentiff	4	0	1512140309	936610459255533568	https://twitter.com/haydentiff/status/936610459255533568				0.22	-0.2041	0

bitcoin ethereum 	At the # ICO Financing conference, the SEC sidesteps nearly every question about regulating # tokens except one that gave many in the audience relief: https://www.forbes.com/sites/laurashin/2017/12/01/sec-gives-advice-on-icos-but-leaves-questions-unanswered/#762148ce398e … # bitcoin # ethereum	laurashin	54	34	1512144483	936627966271897600	https://twitter.com/laurashin/status/936627966271897600		# # #762148ce398e # #		0.27	0.4767	0
bitcoin 	Yes, agree with you about money being a social construct. I think Bitcoin’s value has to do with more people understanding the breakthrough it represents. (Or I hope it does! Let’s hope it’s not all people who heard from their neighbor it will make them rich.)	laurashin	2	0	1512141747	936616488722604032	https://twitter.com/laurashin/status/936616488722604032				0.30	0.4775	0
	OK, maybe none was a little strong, but this reminds about how I was once asked by a publication to write an article comparing innovations in paper money (like anti-counterfeiting) to crypto and I was like, no, it can't be done.
