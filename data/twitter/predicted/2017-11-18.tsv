bitcoin 	Risks with cash-settled bitcoin futures contract: 1. Price index too easily gamed; 2. No physical commodity (private keys) for integrity of short positions; 3. Maintenance margins approaching 100% so no real leverage during volatility; 4.

bitcoin 	I think Bitcoin will prove more difficult to tame than Melamed believes.
