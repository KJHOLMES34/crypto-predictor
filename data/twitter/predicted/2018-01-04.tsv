ripple 	Ripple’s rise: spectacular rejection of fiat, (as is near $1 tr market cap of crypto). The $ USD is in a spectacular bubble that looks close to bursting. @HeisenbergCap (since 2013) has emphasized investing in exchanges to help facilitate the demise of fiat. @stacyherbert #NewDay pic.twitter.com/WygkRNibD1	maxkeiser	109	42	1515076435	948925465993105408	https://twitter.com/maxkeiser/status/948925465993105408		#NewDay	@HeisenbergCap @stacyherbert	0.11	-0.0351

bitcoin litecoin 	Here's Litecoin compared to Bitcoin Cash (Bcash). BCH's equipment cost is only 58% of Litecoin's, and it cost a bit more electricity to secure. Yet, the marketcap is 3x larger. The other problem with BCH security is the risk of Bitcoin miners attacking. Litecoin not affected. pic.twitter.com/MBcBNYmrxX	SatoshiLite	1355	395	1515101065	949028770425421824	https://twitter.com/SatoshiLite/status/949028770425421824				0.00	-0.0252
