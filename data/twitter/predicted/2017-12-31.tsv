	27/ The seasons affect (crypto) trading. Q4/Q1 is when Altcoin markets pick up again. Sell in May and go away has been appropriate for the alt coin market for the last 3 years. Doesn’t mean it will continue to be true in the future.	onemanatatime	197	19	1514729932	947472123903148032	https://twitter.com/onemanatatime/status/947472123903148032				0.30	0.1054	0
	21/ The point of looking at charts, is to decide where the best market opportunities are, and what price and time to enter. If crypto trading is new to you, let me just leave you with some of my overarching thoughts about how to approach trading markets.	onemanatatime	99	9	1514729802	947471581516767233	https://twitter.com/onemanatatime/status/947471581516767233				0.53	0.3634	0
bitcoin 	18/ I’m just an average human who found out about Bitcoin couple years earlier than most, stuck to my beliefs, and spent a lot of time observing and learning how to play the game. Even with making a ton of mistakes, I managed to outperform the market, and I’m sure you can too.	onemanatatime	140	8	1514729744	947471335126532097	https://twitter.com/onemanatatime/status/947471335126532097				0.15	-0.012	0
	10/ I’m trying to improve all the time. I may not be the most analytical person, but I play to my strengths, such as listening to my instincts (having trained them for years).

bitcoin 	7/ Anyway, my security is horrible. I lost 95% of my coins in 2014 getting hacked coz I didn’t have 2FA on my exchange. Got scammed on bitcointalk a couple times. Got phished once or twice.

bitcoin 	6/ Common fallacy is that anyone who heard about or got into bitcoin early is rich today. Anyone who got in before 2015 might have sold much earlier. Anyone who got in after 2015 might have sold 10x ago, or had his coins hacked along the way and have had to restart.	onemanatatime	165	16	1514729416	947469961076686850	https://twitter.com/onemanatatime/status/947469961076686850				0.12	0.0518	0
bitcoin 	3/ By most measures, Bitcoin adoption is still in the early adopter phase and there’s a huge once-in-a-lifetime opportunity sitting right under our noses if we care to look.

bitcoin ripple 	The Ripple validators don't actually just validate, they decide what the consensus actually is.

ripple 	If I were Ripple, I'd just say that Ripple is a centralized payment network that can be audited by third parties for transaction validity.
