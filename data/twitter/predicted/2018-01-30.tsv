bitcoin 	Well it's important to understand that the people commenting on it don't like Bitcoin. Every market is being manipulated and a lot of markets eventually dump to 80% from the top. Top was $20k so theoretically that would be $4k. But that has nothing to do with Tether.

bitcoin 	That's because there are no facts. @bitflnexed sold all his coins around $1300/Bitcoin & got very frustrated.
