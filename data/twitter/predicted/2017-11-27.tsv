bitcoin 	I don’t buy the whole “it’s digital gold” argument. If the government wants to take your gold they have to come to your home and use force. To stop Bitcoin they just have to say “using Bitcoin is now illegal” and hence kill the USD on/off ramps.	ummjackson	1	0	1511738563	934925412295000064	https://twitter.com/ummjackson/status/934925412295000064				0.06	-0.3819	0
