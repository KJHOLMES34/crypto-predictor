bitcoin 	Yes, if the algorithm is simple and has no exploit. It's hard to beat Bitcoin's diff change algo in simplicity. And complicated ago leads to potential bugs. Very likely that miners can exploit BCH's new DAA to make more money.	SatoshiLite	2	0	1510496134	929714288226320385	https://twitter.com/SatoshiLite/status/929714288226320385				0.17	-0.0449	0
litecoin 	Forgot to mention. BCH is a lot more miner centralized. Because its network hashrate is a lot less than BTC, a small BTC pool can 51% attack it. So it's security is weak because of that. Litecoin doesn't have this problem because Litecoin dominates Scrypt hashing.

bitcoin 	BCH also uses the same address space. So much confusion. This hurts everyone. Given all that, the only possible outcome is that one coin will go to $0 in the long term. My bet is obviously on Bitcoin. All the short term price movement doesn't really matter. I'm not trading it.

bitcoin 	BCH also has brand confusion. That's why people refer to it as Bcash. That's honestly a better name than Bitcoin Cash, which is a mouthful.

bitcoin 	Without decentralization, you lose censorship resistance. Censorship resistance is what gives Bitcoin value. Without that, it's just PayPal 2.0, which is not revolutionary. BCH also has a very weak dev team when compared to Bitcoin Core. It's like high school team against pros.

bitcoin 	To be honest, BCH can compete well against LTC to be Bitcoin's silver. But their arrogance wouldn't let settle for second. Their current strategy is winner take all against Bitcoin, and they will lose because of these reasons: Perpetual onchain scaling destroys decentralization	SatoshiLite	1000	287	1510484691	929666294806331393	https://twitter.com/SatoshiLite/status/929666294806331393				0.19	-0.0761	0

bitcoin 	Technical Analysis ISN'T magic. It's just pattern recognition & proper assignment of probabilities to future price movements based on historical movement (also see Fractals).

bitcoin 	So # Bitcoin is falling even faster than I expected. The $5,000(ish) is the most probabilistic reversal point. $1,250-$1,300 is the 2nd most likely.
