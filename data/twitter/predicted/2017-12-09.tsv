ripple 	You don’t get that Ripple and XRP are 2 different things. All of that decentralization talk was real. Ripple is a private company. They hold XRP. I hold XRP. You hold XRP. None of us are obligated to one another.	haydentiff	1	0	1512860281	939630239809929216	https://twitter.com/haydentiff/status/939630239809929216				-0.10	0.0	0
ripple 	There is no guarantee that the price of ANY asset will rise. Maybe it will, maybe it won’t. Stop looking to @ Ripple to make it happen. If you want $ XRP to have more value, stop treating this as a spectator sport and get off your ass and make it happen.	haydentiff	19	6	1512859780	939628138895732740	https://twitter.com/haydentiff/status/939628138895732740			@	0.13	-0.1085	0

bitcoin 	ICO correction could see bitcoin dominance index back at 90%. I wonder if some ICOs invest the capital in other ICOs - would that cause ICO contagion run if the ICO speculation sneezed?

bitcoin 	So the next phase of the bitcoin game is political, explicitly so. I imagine we're going to see Congress getting heavily involved, and debates about a Federal ban. They'll debate reining it in by force in 2018, but probably not act until 2019 or 2020. That's my best guess.	leashless	48	8	1512792931	939347753511063553	https://twitter.com/leashless/status/939347753511063553				0.29	0.0199	0
bitcoin 	Mining was meant to be distributed. The Bitcoin security method collapsed when the number of significant miners collapsed. But the distributed mining strategy also gave us a form of (fairly) basic income. ASIC mining broke bitcoin really, really badly, I'm sorry to say.	leashless	5	1	1512792702	939346792658989056	https://twitter.com/leashless/status/939346792658989056				-0.21	-0.1788	0
bitcoin 	So the question is this: how big can bitcoin get before US Federal action is required to defend the dollar? Is there enough money in the ecosystem to buy enough influence to delay that action? Is there a strategy to coordinate that defence? Big games now. Dangerous ones.

bitcoin 	It's a mess. This is what revolutions look like, for sure. Enormous redistributions of wealth. Two paradigms colliding.
