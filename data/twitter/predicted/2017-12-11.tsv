bitcoin 	as an introductory offer CBOE isn't charging commission, but normally would. there is margin so you have a small amount of leverage (meaning you can deposit 44% of the price of a bitcoin and buy a future for a whole bitcoin). but if the price falls you will have to add more money	adam3us	9	0	1512958801	940043465139699713	https://twitter.com/adam3us/status/940043465139699713				0.04	0.0	0

bitcoin 	Time passed & suddenly we see more news coming from SBI going full BCash and all the usual suspects saying how this is a big deal. https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/7irj77/sbi_group_declares_bitcoin_cash_true_bitcoin_bch/ … There's another piece to the puzzle. Remember @ John_Blocke? The guy who wrote some fud pieces a while back on Roger's behalf.

bitcoin 	They got bamboozled by Roger and CSW. In October there was an article where the SBI CEO claimed he discussed a couple of things with Satoshi. This highlights a problem in # Bitcoin today.

	6/ If you want your # cryptoasset to become a reserve asset, treat your community carefully. It is the loyalty and trust that could preserve your network value long term.	cburniske	45	12	1513006576	940243844901363712	https://twitter.com/cburniske/status/940243844901363712		#		0.00	0.7833	0
