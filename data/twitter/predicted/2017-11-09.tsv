bitcoin litecoin 	Like I said, relay fees are controlled by a constant. Since LTC value went up more than 10x, so has relay fees. We will lower them. Why not support both Litecoin and Bitcoin Cash?

bitcoin 	Unfortunately, with a decentralized system, you can't do centralized planning like this. It comes with the territory.
