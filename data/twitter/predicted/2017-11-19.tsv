bitcoin 	Not really. You can trust the Blockchain because it has more hashing power than any other system and it has more hashing power than any other system because of Bitcoin. If you remove Bitcoin the Blockchain disappears, just like if you remove TCP/IP the Internet disappears.	wences	5	2	1511104982	932267984583880704	https://twitter.com/wences/status/932267984583880704				0.04	0.0641	0

bitcoin 	I use it from time to time to arbitrage. I think it's completely ridiculous to attribute Bitcoin's rise to Tether. Yes more Tether is being created since there is more money coming into crypto. That being said the auditing/transparency is concerning/annoying.
